Identifying the potential links between populations is one of the key tools that can improve the current management across fisheries areas. In addition to characterising populations' contamination state, chemical compounds can help refine foraging areas, individual flows and populations' structure, especially when combined with other intrinsic biogeochemical (trophic) markers such as carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. This study investigated the bioaccumulation of seven selected trace metals - chromium, nickel, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead - in the muscle of 443 albacore tunas, collected over two seasons and/or years in the western Indian Ocean (WIO: Reunion Island and Seychelles) and in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean (SEAO: South Africa). The main factor that explained metal concentration variability was the geographic origin of fish, rather than the size and the sex of individuals, or the season/year of sampling. The elements Cu, Zn, Cd and Hg indicated a segregation of the geographic groups most clearly. For similar sized-individuals, tunas from SEAO had significantly higher concentrations in Cu, Zn and Cd, but lower Hg concentrations than those from WIO. Information inferred from the analysis of trophic markers (delta C-13, delta N-15) and selected persistent organic pollutants, as well as information on stomach contents, corroborated the geographical differences obtained by trace metals. It also highlighted the influence of trophic ecology on metal bioaccumulation. Finally, this study evidenced the potential of metals and chemical contaminants in general as tracers, by segregating groups of individuals using different food webs or habitats, to better understand spatial connectivity at the population scale. Limited flows of individuals between the SEAO and the WIO are suggested. Albacore as predatory fish also provided some information on environmental and food web chemical contamination in the different study areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modeling the role and impact of alien species and fisheries on the Israeli marine continental shelf ecosystem	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Eastern Mediterranean Sea; Food web; Ecopath model; Alien species; Fishing	EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA; FOOD-WEB MODELS; FISHING IMPACTS; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; ECOPATH; ECOSIM; CONSEQUENCES; COMPLEXITY	The ecosystems of the Israeli Mediterranean coast have undergone significant changes in recent decades mainly due to species invasions and fishing. In order to characterize the structure and functioning of the marine continental shelf of the Israeli Mediterranean coast and assess temporal changes, we developed a food web model representing two time periods: 1990-1994 and 2008-2012. The 1990-1994 and 2008-2012 food web models were composed of 39 and 41 functional groups, respectively. Functional groups ranged from primary producers to top predators, and included six and eight alien functional groups, respectively, encompassing several crustacean and fish species. Input data included local surveys and fishery statistics, published data on stomach content analyses, and the application of empirical equations to estimate consumption and production rates. Results of the competitive interactions between alien and native species and changes in trophic flows between food web components highlight the increasing impact of alien species over time. Fishing had noticeable impacts in both time periods and played an important role in the ecosystem. Despite different productivity rates and other environmental differences, the Israeli marine ecosystem shared common structural and functional traits with other Mediterranean marine ecosystems. This is the first attempt to study the ecosystem of the Levant region using mass-balance models and to integrate such a large amount of alien species into food web analyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

An agent-based bioenergetics model for predicting impacts of environmental change on a top marine predator, the Weddell seal	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Bioenergetics; Pinnipeds; Agent-based model; Climate change; Fishing pressure	NORTHERN ELEPHANT SEAL; TROPHIC-LEVEL PREDATORS; LEPTONYCHOTES-WEDDELLII; HARP SEALS; HALICHOERUS-GRYPUS; HABITAT SELECTION; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHOCID SEALS; GREY SEAL	One of the crucial scientific challenges of this century is characterizing the vulnerability of ecosystems to climate change. Bioenergetics models can provide a theoretical construct for addressing specific physiological and ecological hypotheses about how individuals may respond; however, many models fail to link energy deficiencies with reproductive consequences, and thus cannotbe used to predict population-level impacts. Here, we present an agent-based, ecophysiological model that simulates the energy balance of adult, female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). The input parameters include physiological values and population -wide ranges for the duration and phenology of life history events. Energy intake depends on foraging effort and stochastic prey availability, whereas energy expenditure is calculated from time and behavior-specific demands. The simulated seal selects an activity (forage, nurse pup, molt, rest) based on body condition and life history constraints. At the end of each timestep, the energy budget is balanced, and catabolism or anabolism occurs. Following model development and validation with empirical data, simulations were run to study the responses of individuals to: (1) baseline conditions; and (2) reduced prey availability. As expected, the model replicated the known fluctuations in energetic requirements associated with reproduction and molt. A 10% reduction in prey availability resulted in seals foraging more and resting less. At the end of the year-long simulations, animals in the baseline simulation had significantly higher body masses than animals in the perturbation simulation. The model was successfully used to explore decision-based energy allocation strategies that occur under different energetic stressors and to elucidate how extrinsic conditions can impact individual fitness. Identifying the temporal sensitivities of Weddell seals to predicted anthropogenic changes is a valuable contribution to the study of global change biology and can inform management decisions in polar regions.

We characterized and compared blubber contaminants and hormones of a pregnant harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) with B-cell lymphoma, with those in two presumed healthy fishery by-caught porpoises with no lymphoma: a pregnant adult and female juvenile. Common historic use compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and pesticides, were evaluated in blubber samples from three porpoises. In addition, blubber cortisol and progesterone levels (ng/g) were determined in all three animals. Total pollutant concentrations were highest in the juvenile porpoise, followed by the lymphoma porpoise and the nonlymphoma adult. Blubber cortisol concentrations were 191% greater in the pregnant with lymphoma porpoise compared with the pregnant no lymphoma porpoise, and 89% greater in the juvenile female compared with the pregnant no lymphoma porpoise. Although both adults were pregnant, progesterone levels were substantially greater (90%) in the healthy compared with the lymphoma adult. Health monitoring of top-level marine predators, such as porpoise, provides a sentinel measure of contaminants that serve as indicators of potential environmental exposure to humans.

Evidence is also growing for direct impacts of microplastic ingestion on physiology, reproductive success and survival of exposed marine organisms, and transfer through food webs, although the ecological implications are not yet known. Concerns also remain over the capacity for microplastics to act as vectors for harmful chemical pollutants, including plastic additives and persistent organic pollutants, although their contribution must be evaluated alongside other known sources. The potential for humans, as top predators, to consume microplastics as contaminants in seafood is very real, and its implications for health need to be considered. An urgent need also exists to extend the geographical scope of studies of microplastic contamination in seafood species to currently underrepresented areas, and to finalize and adopt standardized methods and quality-assurance protocols for the isolation, identification, and quantification of microplastic contaminants from biological tissues. Such developments would enable more robust investigation of spatial and temporal trends, thereby contributing further evidence as a sound basis for regulatory controls. Despite the existence of considerable uncertainties and unknowns, there is already a compelling case for urgent actions to identify, control, and, where possible, eliminate key sources of both primary and secondary microplastics before they reach the marine environment.

The large number of estuaries globally necessitates risk assessment to prioritise conservation efforts. Schemes for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse have been designed around terrestrial ecosystems, often defined by a single characteristic vegetation type, with their applicability to estuaries unclear. Here we consider the causes and symptoms of estuarine ecosystem collapse and assess, using a case study of the Chesapeake Bay, the applicability of ecosystem-level risk assessments to estuarine ecosystems, typified by mosaics of habitats. Functional estuaries are characterised by habitat heterogeneity and connectivity, maintenance of constituent habitats through recruitment, and a complex trophic structure including apex predators. Additionally, primary production and biomass are dominated by benthic, as opposed to pelagic, species. Hence, homogenisation of habitat types, decreased connectivity, recruitment failure, loss of apex predators and a decreased ratio of benthic to pelagic biomass may be symptoms of a trajectory towards collapse. In terrestrial ecosystems, criteria used for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse include declining or restricted distribution of ecosystems, degradation of the abiotic environment, changes in species composition and declining ecological function. As the boundaries of estuaries are typically defined by topography, rarely do significant changes in the area of the ecosystem occur. Furthermore, because the extent of estuaries is typically small, assessments based on area of occupancy may over-inflate risk. Instead, criteria based on abiotic and biotic changes, many of which are documented through monitoring programs, may be most useful for risk assessments of estuarine ecosystems.

Consequently, climate change may alter the importance of predators with repercussions for ecosystem functioning and structure. In North-eastern Pacific kelp forests, the starfish Pycnopodia helianthoides is known to be an important predator of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Here we investigated the influence of water temperature on this predator-prey interaction by: (i) assessing the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of both species across a temperature gradient in the northern Channel Islands, California, and (ii) investigating how the feeding rate of P.helianthoides on S.purpuratus is affected by temperature in laboratory tests. On average, at sites where mean annual temperatures were <14 degrees C, P.helianthoides were common, S.purpuratus was rare and kelp was persistent, whereas where mean annual temperatures exceeded 14 degrees C, P.helianthoides and kelp were rare and S.purpuratus abundant. Temperature was found to be the primary environmental factor influencing P.helianthoides abundance, and in turn P.helianthoides was the primary determinant of S.purpuratus abundance. In the laboratory, temperatures >16 degrees C (equivalent to summer temperatures at sites where P.helianthoides were rare) reduced predation rates regardless of predator and prey sizes, although larger sea urchins were consumed only by large starfishes. These results clearly demonstrate that the effect of P.helianthoides on S.purpuratus is strongly mediated by temperature, and that the local abundance and predation rate of P.helianthoides on sea urchins will likely decrease with future warming. A reduction in top-down control on sea urchins, combined with other expected impacts of climate change on kelp, poses significant risks for the persistence of kelp forests in the future.

Whelk predators exhibit limited population responses and community effects following disease-driven declines of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Sea star wasting disease; SSWD; Rocky intertidal; Oregon; Subordinate predators; Nucella; Mytilus; Mesopredator release	ROCKY INTERTIDAL COMMUNITY; TROPHIC CASCADES; INTERACTION STRENGTH; FOOD WEBS; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; MESOPREDATOR RELEASE; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; MASS MORTALITY; FEEDING RATES; TOP PREDATORS	The recent outbreak of sea star wasting disease (SSWD) along the US West Coast, which has decimated the intertidal keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus, is predicted to change community structure by reducing predatory control of the competitively dominant mussel Mytilus californianus. However, keystone species effects can be variable, and the role of other predators without the keystone predator is not well understood. We were interested in the effects of subordinate whelk predators (Nucella ostrina, N. canaliculata) on prey following SSWD, and whelk population responses to declines of their predator and competitor P. ochraceus. We hypothesized that whelks would limit M. californianus establishment by reducing prey species facilitating its recruitment. We also predicted that whelk populations would increase and shift downshore with reduced predation threat. We addressed our questions using a whelk removal experiment started before the SSWD outbreak peak, and surveys of whelk distribution, abundance, and size structure. In the absence of P. ochraceus, whelks weakly facilitated, rather than limited, the establishment of the competitively dominant mussel but had few effects on other prey abundance. One year after SSWD onset, surveys indicated no change in whelk vertical distributions but revealed diverging patterns in abundance of whelk species. Whelk size structure shifted to smaller individuals, indicating a potentially lagged population response. Our results suggest that subordinate predators may not have strong short-term impacts on prey communities after keystone species decline. However, poor prey recruitment may have limited any whelk effects and population changes. Our study provides important context for understanding community dynamics following one of the largest marine disease outbreaks recorded.

The survival of the Endangered African penguin Spheniscus demersus is closely linked to the availability of pelagic fish prey. This study assesses the influence of oceanographic variables on the spatio-temporal dynamics of pelagic fish in Algoa Bay, South Africa, where half of the world population of African penguins breed on 2 islands, St Croix and Bird. Using small-scale acoustic surveys and an array of underwater oceanographic data recorders spread across the bay during 3 yr, we reveal the complex and variable nature of this system, with fish responding differently to physical processes around each island. Chlorophyll a concentrations were good predictors of relative fish abundance around Bird Island but had little influence around St Croix Island, possibly due to the masking effect of purse-seine fishing around this site. The horizontal distribution of fish schools around Bird Island was more aggregated under upwelling conditions (cooler sea surface temperatures) and the vertical distribution of fish around both islands was strongly influenced by stratification and mean temperatures. Mechanistic drivers of upwelling included northeasterly winds and offshore Natal pulses, both of which are predicted to have an increasingly more significant effect on the suitability of habitat for pelagic fish and associated predators under the influences of climate change and industrial fishing.

Standard techniques to study the ocean temperature in situ are, however, particularly limited by their time and spatial coverage, problems which might be partially mitigated by using marine top predators as biological platforms for oceanographic sampling. We used small archival tags deployed on 33 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), and obtained 21,070 geo-localized profiles of water temperature, during late spring of 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013; in a region of the North Patagonian Sea with limited oceanographic records in situ. We compared our in situ data of sea surface temperature (SST) with those available from satellite remote sensing; to describe the three-dimensional temperature fields around the area of influence of two important tidal frontal systems; and to study the inter-annual variation in the three-dimensional temperature fields. There was a strong positive relationship between satellite- and animal-derived SST data although there was an overestimation by remote-sensing by a maximum difference of +2 degrees C. Little inter-annual variability in the 3-dimensional temperature fields was found, with the exception of 2012 (and to a lesser extent in 2013) where the SST was significantly higher. In 2013, we found weak stratification in a region which was unexpected. In addition, during the same year, a warm small-scale vortex is indicated by the animal-derived temperature data. This allowed us to describe and better understand the dynamics of the water masses, which, so far, have been mainly studied by remote sensors and numerical models. Our results highlight again the potential of using marine top predators as biological platforms to collect oceanographic data, which will enhance and accelerate studies on the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. In a changing world, threatened by climate change, it is urgent to fill information gaps on the coupled ocean-atmosphere system allowing to link the hydrothermal process to the at-sea distribution of top predators.

An increasingly common strategy to mitigate bycatch of harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), a small and protected marine top predator, involves the use of pingers (acoustic alarms that emit underwater noise) and time-area fishing closures. Although these mitigation measures can reduce harbor porpoise bycatch in gillnet fisheries considerably, inference about the long-term population-level consequences is currently lacking. We developed a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model (IBM) with the aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these two bycatch mitigation measures. We quantified both the direct positive effects (i.e., reduced bycatch) and any indirect negative effects (i.e., reduced foraging efficiency) on the population size using the inner Danish waters as a biological system. The model incorporated empirical data on gillnet fishing effort and noise avoidance behavior by free-ranging harbor porpoises exposed to randomized high-frequency (20- to 160-kHz) pinger signals. The IBM simulations revealed a synergistic relationship between the implementation of time-area fishing closures and pinger deployment. Time-area fishing closures reduced bycatch rates substantially but not completely. In contrast, widespread pinger deployment resulted in total mitigation of bycatch but frequent and recurrent noise avoidance behavior in high-quality foraging habitat negatively affected individual survival and the total population size. When both bycatch mitigation measures were implemented simultaneously, the negative impact of pinger noise-induced sub-lethal behavioral effects on the population was largely eliminated with a positive effect on the population size that was larger than when the mitigation measures were used independently. Our study highlights that conservationists and policy makers need to consider and balance both the direct and indirect effects of harbor porpoise bycatch mitigation measures before enforcing their widespread implementation. Individual-based simulation models, such as the one presented here, offer an efficient and dynamic framework to evaluate the impact of human activities on the long-term survival of marine populations and can serve as a basis to design adaptive management strategies that satisfy both ecological and socioeconomic demands on marine ecosystems.

Application of an ecosystem model to evaluate the importance of different processes and food web structure for transfer of 13 elements in a shallow lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article						Concentration ratio; Bioaccumulation; Model; Lake; Risk assessment; Food web	AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS; MARINE PLANKTON; MID-SWEDEN; BALTIC SEA; RADIONUCLIDES; TRANSPORT; CARBON; BIOACCUMULATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; ACCUMULATION	In environmental risk assessments of nuclear waste, there is need to estimate the potential risks of a large number of radionuclides over a long time period during which the environment is likely to change. Usually concentration ratios (CRs) are used to calculate the activity concentrations in organisms. However, CRs are not available for all radionuclides and they are not easily scalable to the varying environment. Here, an ecosystem transport model of elements, which estimates concentrations in organisms using carbon flows and food transfer instead of CR is presented. It is a stochastic compartment model developed for Lake Eckarfjarden at Forsmark in Sweden. The model was based on available data on carbon circulation, physical and biological processes from the site and identifies 11 functional groups of organisms. The ecosystem model was used to estimate the environmental transfer of 13 elements (Al, Ca, Cd, CI, Cs, I, Ni, Nb, Pb, Se, Sr, Th, U) to various aquatic organisms, using element-specific distribution coefficients for suspended particles (K-d PM) and upper sediment (K-d sed), and subsequent transfer in the foodweb. The modelled CRs for different organism groups were compared with measured CRs from the lake and literature data, and showed good agreement for many elements and organisms, particularly for lower trophic levels. The model is, therefore, proposed as an alternative to measured CR, though it is suggested to further explore active uptake, assimilation and elimination processes to get better correspondence for some of the elements. The benthic organisms (i.e. bacteria, microphytobenthos and macroalgae) were identified as more important than pelagic organisms for transfer of elements to top predators. The element transfer model revealed that most of the radionuclides were channelled through the microbial loop, despite the fact that macroalgae dominated the carbon fluxes in this lake. Thus, element-specific adsorption of elements to the surface of aquatic species, that may be food sources for organisms at higher trophic levels, needs to be considered in combination with generic processes described by carbon fluxes.

Shifts in intertidal zonation and refuge use by prey after mass mortalities of two predators	ECOLOGY			English	Article						intertidal zonation; Leptasterias spp.; mass mortality; natural experiment; nonconsumptive effects; Pisaster ochraceus; sea star wasting disease; size-dependent predation; Tegula funebralis; tidepool; top-down control; vertical size gradient	SNAIL TEGULA-FUNEBRALIS; LEVEL SIZE GRADIENTS; BLACK TURBAN SNAIL; MARINE SNAIL; LATITUDINAL VARIATION; BODY-TEMPERATURE; HABITAT CHOICE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHASE-SHIFTS; CALIFORNIA	Recent mass mortalities of two predatory sea star species provided an unprecedented opportunity to test the effect of predators on rocky intertidal prey. Mass mortalities provide insight that manipulative experiments cannot because they alter ecosystems on a larger scale, for longer time periods, and remove both organisms and their cues from the environment. We examined shifts in population size structure, vertical zonation, and use of emersed refuge habitats outside tidepools by the abundant herbivorous black turban snail Tegula fune-bralis, both before and after the successive mortalities of two predatory sea stars. The small cryptic predator Leptasterias spp. suffered a localized but extreme mortality event in November 2010, followed by two mass mortalities of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus in August 2011 and autumn 2013. After the local extinction of Leptasterias, the population size of Tegula more than doubled. Also, since Leptasterias primarily inhabited only mid to low intertidal tidepools at this site, small and medium sized snails (which are preferred by Leptasterias) shifted lower in the intertidal and into tidepools after the mortality of Leptasterias. After the mortality of Pisaster in August 2011, large snails did not shift lower in the intertidal zone despite being preferred by Pisaster. Small and medium sized snails became denser in the higher zone and outside tidepools, which was not likely due to Pisaster mortality. Previous studies concluded that Pisaster maintained vertical size gradients of snails, but our data implicate the overlooked predator Leptasterias as the primary cause. This natural experiment indicated that (1) predators exert top-down control over prey population sizes and lower limits, (2) vertical zonation of prey are dynamic and controlled in part by prey behavior, and (3) predators exert the strongest effects on more vulnerable individuals, which typically inhabit stressful habitats higher on the shore or outside tidepools to avoid predation. Because the mass mortalities of two predators drastically reduced both the predation pressure and the chemical cues of predators in the environment, we were able to investigate both the effects of predators on prey-populations and the effects on mobile prey behavior.

J	Wulff, J				Wulff, Janie			Bottom-up and top-down controls on coral reef sponges: disentangling within-habitat and between-habitat processes	ECOLOGY			English	Article						angelfishes; bottom-up; context-dependent; coral reefs; mangroves; seagrass; sponge feeding; sponges; spongivores; top-down; within-habitat vs. between-habitat	CARIBBEAN SPONGES; MARINE SPONGES; FLORIDA BAY; COMMUNITY; POPULATIONS; PARROTFISH; SPONGIVORY; DIVERSITY; MORTALITY; PREDATION	Polarized debates about top-down vs. bottom-up control have given way to more nuanced understanding of control by both resources and consumers in many systems, but coral reef sponges have recently been asserted to differ from other groups in being controlled exclusively top-down. This assertion has been countered by reports of exclusively bottom-up control, with both conclusions based on studies of the same species. Accelerating deterioration of coral reefs motivates knowing the contexts in which either consumers or nutrients or both control key ecosystem role players like sponges. Accordingly, genotype-and size-controlled individuals of 12 common Caribbean reef sponge species were transplanted, in the field, into five circumstances differing in predators, competitors, and the picoplankton consumed by sponges. Growth and survival of the experimental transplants for periods of 1-9 yr revealed context-dependent control of sponges. Primary control of growth was bottom-up, with more picoplankton resulting in consistent and sustained higher growth rates for all 12 of these ecologically and phylogenetically diverse species. Top-down control was not detected within-habitat, on the coral reef. However, between-habitat control was by predation and competition, with reef sponges excluded from adjacent seagrass meadows by spongivorous starfish, and excluded from mangrove prop roots by faster-growing mangrove sponges. These results highlight the strong importance of experimental design details that consider behavior idiosyncrasies, sufficiently long time scales, and appropriate division of species into categories. Diametrically opposite results from studies of the same species also illustrate the inherently greater difficulty of detecting bottom-up processes and the importance of distinguishing within-habitat vs. between-habitat patterns and processes.

We explored the dietary niche of Pomatomus saltatrix in eastern Australia, using a classification tree analysis to identify key factors driving diet variation. P. saltatrix was shown to be an opportunistic generalist predator which exhibited increased baitfish consumption, and decreased crustacean consumption, with increasing size. The classification tree analysis showed that body size and latitude had the greatest influence on the diet of P. saltatrix, with significant ontogenetic diet shifts occurring at 8 and 30 cm fork length (FL). While piscivory is evident in the majority of P. saltatrix diets by similar to 8 cm FL, crustaceans are almost entirely absent from the diet after similar to 30 cm FL. The importance of latitude was likely related to the broad-scale oceanography in the study region, including the East Australian Current and its separation from the continental shelf. The classification tree analysis is a powerful framework for identifying important variables in diet composition.

Central place foragers, such as seabirds and pinnipeds, are thus likely to cope with an increase in the distance between foraging locations and their land-based breeding colonies. Understanding how central place foragers should modify their foraging behavior in response to changes in prey accessibility appears crucial. A spatially explicit individual-based simulation model (Marine Central Place Forager Simulator (MarCPFS)), including bio-energetic components, was built to evaluate effects of possible changes in prey resources accessibility on individual performances and breeding success. The study was calibrated on a particular example: the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazelle), which alternates between oceanic areas in which females feed and the land-based colony in which they suckle their young over a 120 days rearing period. Our model shows the importance of the distance covered to feed and prey aggregation which appeared to be key factors to which animals are highly sensitive. Memorization and learning abilities also appear to be essential breeding success traits. Females were found to be most successful for intermediate levels of prey aggregation and short distance to the resource, resulting in optimal female body length. Increased distance to resources due to climate warming should hinder pups' growth and survival while female body length should increase.

Overwinter habitat selection by Antarctic krill under varying sea-ice conditions: implications for top predators and fishery management	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Southern Ocean; Antarctic krill; Fishery interactions; Sea ice; Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources; CCAMLR; Ocean warming	SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS; CRAB-EATER SEALS; EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BRANSFIELD STRAIT; SCOTIA SEA; FUR SEALS; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; VERTICAL MIGRATION; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS	Climate change will affect Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, krill-dependent predators, and fisheries in the Southern Ocean as areas typically covered by sea ice become ice-free in some winters. Research cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of magnitude higher (8 krill m(-2)) compared to summer (0.25 krill m(-2)), and this pattern was ob served in all winters regardless of ice cover. Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude higher (similar to 5 500 000 metric tons [t] in 2014) than a 15 yr summer average (520 000 t). Looking at krill-dependent predators, during winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in Brans-field Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and in an area that is becoming more frequently ice-free. While long-term projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions, alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the impacts of long-term climate change.

Spatial heterogeneity in the timing of ice melt generates temporal variability in the development of these events across the habitat, offering a natural framework to assess how foraging marine predators respond to the spring phenology. We combined 4 yr of tracking data of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica with synoptic remote-sensing data on sea ice and chlorophyll a to test how the development of melting ice and primary production drive Antarctic petrel foraging. Cross-correlation analyses of first-passage time revealed that Antarctic petrels utilized foraging areas with a spatial scale of 300 km. These areas changed position or disappeared within 10 to 30 d and showed no spatial consistency among years. Generalized additive model (GAM) analyses suggested that the presence of foraging areas was related to the time since ice melt. Antarctic petrels concentrated their search effort in melting areas and in areas that had reached an age of 50 to 60 d from the date of ice melt. We found no significant relationship between search effort and chlorophyll a concentration. We suggest that these foraging patterns were related to the vertical distribution and profitability of the main prey, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Our study demonstrates that the annual ice melt in the Southern Ocean shapes the development of a highly patchy and elusive food web, underscoring the importance of flexible foraging strategies among top predators.

We evaluate how the historical (1950-2011) trends of various ecosystems groups/species have been impacted by changes in primary productivity (PP) combined with fishing pressure. We investigate the whole Mediterranean Sea using a food web modelling approach. Results indicate that both changes in PP and fishing pressure played an important role in driving species dynamics. Yet, PP was the strongest driver upon the Mediterranean Sea ecosystem. This highlights the importance of bottom-up processes in controlling the biological characteristics of the region. We observe a reduction in abundance of important fish species (similar to 34%, including commercial and noncommercial) and top predators (similar to 41%), and increases of the organisms at the bottom of the food web (similar to 23%). Ecological indicators, such as community biomass, trophic levels, catch and diversity indicators, reflect such changes and show overall ecosystem degradation over time. Since climate change and fishing pressure are expected to intensify in the Mediterranean Sea, this study constitutes a baseline reference for stepping forward in assessing the future management of the basin.

In this model, we simulated 15 functional groups spread across an area of 17,049 km(2). The mean trophic level of the present study area is 2.716. The ecotrophic efficiency of the present studied ecosystem is in the range of 0.424 of medium demersals and 0.961 of medium pelagics. Penaeid prawn, small pelagics, and medium pelagics are the most exploited groups of this ecosystem. The coastal northern BoB food web is mainly detritivorous and planktivorous; phytoplankton and detritus positively affected almost all the functional groups, and top predators are essentially absent in the system. The zooplankton and benthos have negative impacts on themselves because of cannibalistic behavior. The average catch per net primary production, i.e. the gross efficiency of the system is around 0.001. The system is low trophic and efficient. Proper ecosystem-based management practice can improve the efficiency of this overexploited ecosystem.

These marine mammals are top predators and their foraging activity plays an important role in the ecosystem dynamics. Three passive acoustics recorders were used to study the temporal and spatial occurrence of the foraging activity of odontocetes (excluding beaked and sperm whales) at three locations along the Kona coast of Hawaii between 2012 and 2013. Echolocation clicks were detected using the M3R1 (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges) system, and custom-designed Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) programs were designed to analyze the detected data. A Generalized Linear Model was used to understand the influence of location and month on the foraging activity. Both location and month affected the foraging activity of Odontocetes in Hawaii. In general, the foraging activity was the highest in the north and the lowest in the south part of the study area. The model revealed that, at each location, the foraging activity tended to decrease over the time of the study. A seasonality seems to be seen for the two southernmost locations. At the northernmost location the foraging activity decreased from February 2012 till 11 months later (January 2013). Odontocetes daily foraging activity was higher at night-time at all locations sampled.	[Giorli, Giacomo; Au, Whitlow W.

Here we describe significant trophic cascades in an open coastal planktonic ecosystem exposed to an introduced top predator. The ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was monitored for an 8-year period concurrent with measures of the food web structure of the plankton and strong trophic cascades were evident. In the 5 years when M. leidyi were found, their target prey (grazing copepods) were reduced 5-fold and the primary producers doubled their biomass when released from the grazing pressure. The increased phytoplankton biomass could unequivocally be assigned to grazing release since concurrent measurements of primary production did not differ between years with or without M. leidyi. Copepod biomass prior to the mass occurrence of the ctenophore was important. The years without M. leidyi had significantly higher biomass of copepods in July, the month preceding the outburst of the ctenophore. The profound changes of the pelagic ecosystem faced with a non-selective apex predator shows that marine communities are not exceptions from trophic cascade mechanisms.

Of the two sub-basins in the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bothnian Sea is more dynamic in its hydrography and food web structure than the Bothnian Bay, due to the variable influence of the more eutrophic and more saline Baltic Proper. Variation in deep-water intrusion from the main Baltic Proper, and its effect on salinity and stratification, had a clear effect on the phyto- and zooplankton communities in the Bothnian Sea. Probably due to this intrusion, the nutrient status in this basin has also changed in terms of nitrogen limitation, with subsequent class- and genus-level changes in phytoplankton community composition. The migration of cod to the Bothnian Sea during the 1980s had profound effects on the herring population, but cascading effects affecting the basis of the food web were not obvious. In contrast to a more pronounced interplay of both top-down control and bottom-up nutrient limitation of the Bothnian Sea, the Bothnian Bay food web was mostly driven by hydrography and climate, and major changes were observed in the basis of the food web. Community changes were observed in both basins in the Gulf of Bothnia throughout the entire time period. Human influence considerably affects both the basis of the food web and its very top, where man has replaced the natural top predators. Though the eutrophication status of the Gulf has been rather stable, the results indicate that the potential symptoms should be surveyed specifically in the Bothnian Sea, and that management of Baltic herring stocks requires an understanding, and thus monitoring, of the entire food web.

Optic-nerve-transmitted eyeshine, a new type of light emission from fish eyes	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Marine visual ecology; Eye anatomy; Eyeshine; Optic nerve; Light guidance; Tripterygiidae; Tripterygion delaisi	TRIPTERYGION-TRIPTERONOTUS RISSO; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; FINE-STRUCTURE; GUINEA-PIG; REEF FISH; TISSUE; TELEOSTEI; HABITAT; RETINA; ANEMONEFISH	Background: Most animal eyes feature an opaque pigmented eyecup to assure that light can enter from one direction only. We challenge this dogma by describing a previously unknown form of eyeshine resulting from light that enters the eye through the top of the head and optic nerve, eventually emanating through the pupil as a narrow beam: the Optic-Nerve-Transmitted (ONT) eyeshine. We characterize ONT eyeshine in the triplefin blenny Tripterygion delaisi (Tripterygiidae) in comparison to three other teleost species, using behavioural and anatomical observations, spectrophotometry, histology, and magnetic resonance imaging. The study's aim is to identify the factors that determine ONT eyeshine occurrence and intensity, and whether these are specifically adapted for that purpose. Results: ONT eyeshine intensity benefits from locally reduced head pigmentation, a thin skull, the gap between eyes and forebrain, the potential light-guiding properties of the optic nerve, and, most importantly, a short distance between the head surface and the optic nerves. Conclusions: The generality of these factors and the lack of specifically adapted features implies that ONT eyeshine is widespread among small fish species. Nevertheless, its intensity varies considerably, depending on the specific combination and varying expression of common anatomical features. We discuss whether ONT eyeshine might affect visual performance, and speculate about possible functions such as predator detection, camouflage, and intraspecific communication.

Interaction between top-down and bottom-up control in marine food webs	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						trophic control; ecosystem modeling; marine food web functioning; wasp-waist; regime shifts	HERRING CLUPEA-HARENGUS; SPRAT SPRATTUS-SPRATTUS; NORTH-SEA; TROPHIC CONTROL; NORWAY POUT; BALTIC SEA; CLIMATE; ECOSYSTEM; PATTERNS; ATLANTIC	Climate change and resource exploitation have been shown to modify the importance of bottom-up and top-down forces in ecosystems. However, the resulting pattern of trophic control in complex food webs is an emergent property of the system and thus unintuitive. We develop a statistical nondeterministic model, capable of modeling complex patterns of trophic control for the heavily impacted North Sea ecosystem. The model is driven solely by fishing mortality and climatic variables and based on time-series data covering >40 y for six plankton and eight fish groups along with one bird group (>20 y). Simulations show the outstanding importance of top-down exploitation pressure for the dynamics of fish populations. Whereas fishing effects on predators indirectly altered plankton abundance, bottom-up climatic processes dominate plankton dynamics. Importantly, we show plank-tivorous fish to have a central role in the North Sea food web initiating complex cascading effects across and between trophic levels. Our linked model integrates bottom-up and top-down effects and is able to simulate complex long-term changes in ecosystem components under a combination of stressor scenarios. Our results suggest that in marine ecosystems, pathways for bottom-up and top-down forces are not necessarily mutually exclusive and together can lead to the emergence of complex patterns of control.

Resetting predator baselines in coral reef ecosystems	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CAPTURE-RECAPTURE DATA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SHARK POPULATIONS; DENSITY; OCEAN; EXTINCTION; ISLANDS; BIOMASS; MARINE; SIZE	What did coral reef ecosystems look like before human impacts became pervasive? Early efforts to reconstruct baselines resulted in the controversial suggestion that pristine coral reefs have inverted trophic pyramids, with disproportionally large top predator biomass. The validity of the coral reef inverted trophic pyramid has been questioned, but until now, was not resolved empirically. We use data from an eight-year tag-recapture program with spatially explicit, capture-recapture models to re-examine the population size and density of a key top predator at Palmyra atoll, the same location that inspired the idea of inverted trophic biomass pyramids in coral reef ecosystems. Given that animal movement is suspected to have significantly biased early biomass estimates of highly mobile top predators, we focused our reassessment on the most mobile and most abundant predator at Palmyra, the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). We estimated a density of 21.3 (95% CI 17.8, 24.7) grey reef sharks/km(2), which is an order of magnitude lower than the estimates that suggested an inverted trophic pyramid. Our results indicate that the trophic structure of an unexploited reef fish community is not inverted, and that even healthy top predator populations may be considerably smaller, and more precarious, than previously thought.

Species diversity, abundance, biomass, size and trophic structure of fish on coral reefs in relation to shark abundance	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Apex predator; Mesopredators; Herbivores; Food web; Lethal effects; Ecosystems; Natural experiments	BODY-SIZE; CARCHARHINUS-AMBLYRHYNCHOS; COMMUNITIES; CASCADES; ISLANDS; CONNECTIVITY; ASSEMBLAGES; ECOSYSTEMS; PROTECTION; PREDATORS	Theory predicts that loss of gape-limited sharks should lead to increases in the abundance and biomass of smaller size classes of prey. We used stereo-baited remote underwater video stations (stereo-BRUVS) and stereo diver-operated video systems (stereo-DOVS) to characterise the shark and fish assemblages on 2 remote, atoll-like reef systems in northwestern Australia, the Rowley Shoals and the Scott Reefs. Whereas the Rowley Shoals is a marine protected area, sharks have been removed from the Scott Reefs for over 3 centuries. We found that sharks were significantly more diverse, more abundant, larger in size and greater in biomass in the marine reserve relative to the Scott Reefs. Consistent with a priori hypotheses, bony fishes displayed greater species diversity, abundance and biomass where sharks were common relative to the predator-depleted location. The size and trophic structure of bony fish assemblages also differed between locations. Our results provide large-scale evidence consistent with the hypothesis that reef-associated sharks are gape-limited trophic omnivores that impose top-down effects on medium sized (<50 cm), low- to mid-trophic level fishes. On stereo-BRUVS, for example, prey in the 0 to 29.99 cm size class had 203% more biomass at the predator-depleted reef relative to the location where sharks were abundant. As body size is an important determinant of ecological role and fitness in fishes, these findings suggest that the rapid and ongoing loss of sharks from reefs globally may have important implications for reef management and investigations into the effect of fishing on reef systems.

To evaluate the ecosystem dynamics within the GoM, we developed a mass balanced Ecopath model ("nGoM Ecopath") which integrated ecosystem stressors, indirect effects of fishing (e.g. bycatch), and predator-prey dynamics. A meta-analysis of diet composition filled critical gaps in higher trophic level predator-prey linkages, such as predation on economically important groupers (Serranidae). Compared to previous Ecopath models of the GoM, nGoM Ecopath displayed higher ecosystem complexity including higher connectivity amongst trophic groups and increased omnivory. Mixed trophic impact analysis revealed species including snappers, groupers, pelagic coastal piscivores, oceanic piscivores, cephalopods, and dolphins as critical top-down predators. Bottom-up effects were identified for juvenile groupers and mackerels, which benefited from high production of invertebrates and small fishes. Network analysis revealed detrimental effects of red tides on sharks, skates and rays, and demersal coastal invertebrate feeders such as black drum, as well as adult red and gag grouper. Pelagic coastal piscivores (e.g. jacks (Carangidae)), snappers (Lutjanidae), and mobile epifauna (e.g. lobsters) imposed the largest influence on ecosystem structure as keystone predators. The nGoM Ecopath model using the dynamic module Ecosim can help guide restoration efforts through the evaluation of multispecies responses to management actions and identification of ecosystem trade-offs.

Concentrations were measured in blood of a large number (n=412-521 blood samples, depending on the data analyses) of prebreeding, incubating, and chick-rearing birds over a period of 5yr (2007-2011). The PCB-153 concentrations were equal in male and female blood in the prebreeding period, whereas females had significantly lower concentrations during incubation and chick rearing, probably because of their ability to eliminate organochlorines through egg laying. A similar temporal pattern was observed with DDE, although the lower concentrations in incubating females were not significant. Males and females had similar concentrations of HCB over all reproductive stages. The concentrations of all 3 compounds varied greatly between years. The concentrations of PCB-153 tended to decline over the study period, whereas concentrations of HCB showed an increasing trend, especially among chick-rearing males late in the season. Concentrations of PCB-153 increased approximately 2.5 times from the prebreeding to the chick-rearing period, concurrent with mobilization of body lipids (reduced body mass). A similar, but less pronounced trend was found for HCB. For DDE, however, kittiwakes had the highest concentrations in the prebreeding period, suggesting relatively high exposure in their winter areas. The present study documented large variations in circulating concentrations of legacy organochlorines among and within breeding seasons in kittiwakes, but the alterations within seasons were relatively consistent from year to year.

In this study, available tracking data from nine species of seabirds and marine mammals breeding at Kerguelen were analysed to define potential boundaries for a Marine Protected Area. Maps of time spent per square of each species were first used to describe high-use areas within the Kerguelen Plateau. Habitat models were then developed for four species (Black-browed albatross, Wandering albatross, King penguin and Antarctic fur seal) chosen on the basis of their contrasted foraging ecology and diet to represent the top predator community. Predictive models were then applied to the main colonies of the four species for which no tracking data were available to illustrate the most important feeding areas at the scale of the entire study zone. An area delineated by the central part of the plateau and its slopes appeared to be of great importance for the top predators' community and would appropriately complete the limits of the existing Australian marine reserve of Heard and McDonald Islands.

Seasonal variation in the diet of Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, at 25 de Mayo/King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Diet; Arctocephalus gazella; South Shetlands; Antarctica	SUMMER-AUTUMN PERIOD; MIROUNGA-LEONINA; ELEPHANT SEAL; FISH; VARIABILITY; PENINSULA; ECOSYSTEM; WINTER; PREY	Assessing the trophic ecology of fur seals is essential for defining their roles as a top predator in Antarctic marine ecosystems. To this end, we examined the diet of Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, in the South Shetlands. While previous studies have considered the diet of this species at this location in summer, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the diet of this population in winter, thus adding essential information on the extent of seasonal variation. A total of 224 scats were collected in the winter 2004 (n = 118) and summer 2004/2005 (n = 106) on the coasts of Stranger Point, Isla 25 de Mayo/King George. For the total study period krill (Euphausia superba) was the main prey taxon, followed by fish, cephalopods and penguins. During winter Pleuragramma antarcticum was dominant, while myctophids were almost absent. Conversely, in summer Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, followed by P. antarcticum, dominated the fish diet. It is concluded that fur seals centred their foraging activity on a krill community and fish associated with krill aggregations.	[Harrington, A.; Daneri, G. A.; Reygert, D.

Tracking, feather moult and stable isotopes reveal foraging behaviour of a critically endangered seabird during the non-breeding season	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Balearic shearwater; diet; discards; feeding ecology; fisheries; migration; trophic	SHEARWATER PUFFINUS-MAURETANICUS; ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA; BISCAY NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; SMALL PELAGIC FISH; BALEARIC SHEARWATER; IBERIAN PENINSULA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TOP PREDATOR; FOOD-WEB; ENGRAULIS-ENCRASICOLUS	Aim The movement patterns of marine top predators are likely to reflect responses to prey distributions, which themselves can be influenced by factors such as climate and fisheries. The critically endangered Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus has shown a recent northwards shift in non-breeding distribution, tentatively linked to changing forage fish distribution and/or fisheries activity. Here, we provide the first information on the foraging ecology of this species during the non-breeding period. Location Breeding grounds in Mallorca, Spain, and non-breeding areas in the north-east Atlantic and western Mediterranean. Methods Birdborne geolocation was used to identify non-breeding grounds. Information on feather moult (from digital images) and stable isotopes (of both primary wing feathers and potential prey items) was combined to infer foraging behaviour during the non-breeding season. Results Almost all breeding shearwaters (n = 32) migrated to non-breeding areas in the Atlantic from southern Iberia to the French Atlantic coast, where the majority of primary feather moult took place. Birds foraging off western Iberia yielded feather isotope ratios consistent with a diet composed largely of pelagic fishes, while the isotopic composition of birds foraging in the Bay of Biscay suggested an additional contribution of benthic prey, most likely from demersal fishery discards. Main conclusions Combined application of geolocators and stable isotopes indicates spatial variation in dietary behaviour and interactions with fisheries. Our results imply that both pelagic fish and fisheries discards are important components of diet during the non-breeding period, which may have implications for the at-sea distribution of this migratory species. These findings will contribute to bycatch mitigation in non-breeding areas and provide baseline data that should inform future assessment of seabird responses to changing fishery practices and prey distributions.

The blowout released complex mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into critical pelagic spawning habitats for tunas, billfishes, and other ecologically important top predators. Crude oil disrupts cardiac function and has been associated with heart malformations in developing fish. However, the precise identity of cardiotoxic PAHs, and the mechanisms underlying contractile dysfunction are not known. Here we show that phenanthrene, a PAH with a benzene 3-ring structure, is the key moiety disrupting the physiology of heart muscle cells. Phenanthrene is a ubiquitous pollutant in water and air, and the cellular targets for this compound are highly conserved across vertebrates. Our findings therefore suggest that phenanthrene may be a major worldwide cause of vertebrate cardiac dysfunction.

Protection of large predators in a marine reserve alters size-dependent prey mortality	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						kelp forest; urchin; size-dependent predation; size refuge; marine reserves	KELP FOREST; SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; BODY-SIZE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TROPHIC CASCADES; SEA-URCHINS; FISH; MODELS; POPULATIONS; ECOSYSTEMS	Where predator-prey interactions are size-dependent, reductions in predator size owing to fishing has the potential to disrupt the ecological role of top predators in marine ecosystems. In southern California kelp forests, we investigated the size-dependence of the interaction between herbivorous sea urchins and one of their predators, California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). Empirical tests examined how differences in predator size structure between reserve and fished areas affected size-specific urchin mortality. Sites inside marine reserves had greater sheephead size and biomass, while empirical feeding trials indicated that larger sheephead were required to successfully consume urchins of increasing test diameter. Evaluations of the selectivity of sheephead for two urchin species indicated that shorterspined purple urchins were attacked more frequently and successfully than longer-spined red urchins of the same size class, particularly at the largest test diameters. As a result of these size-specific interactions and the higher biomass of large sheephead inside reserves, urchin mortality rates were three times higher inside the reserve for both species. In addition, urchin mortality rates decreased with urchin size, and very few large urchins were successfully consumed in fished areas. The truncation of sheephead size structure that commonly occurs owing to fishing will probably result in reductions in urchin mortality, which may reduce the resilience of kelp beds to urchin barren formation. By contrast, the recovery of predator size structure in marine reserves may restore this resilience, but may be delayed until fish grow to sizes capable of consuming larger urchins.

Establishment of marine protected areas alone does not restore coral reef communities in Belize	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Coral reef; Belize; Coral recruitment; Trophic cascades; Parrotfish; MPAs	WHITE-BAND DISEASE; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; HERBIVOROUS FISHES; CARIBBEAN CORALS; FLORIDA-KEYS; DIADEMA-ANTILLARUM; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; MACROALGAL COVER; WAVE EXPOSURE; PHASE-SHIFTS	A variety of factors have caused the loss of corals and fishes on coral reefs, resulting in ecological, social, and economic consequences for reef ecosystems and the people who depend on them. A widely employed management action to restore reef communities is the implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs). We measured the effectiveness of the MPA network in Belize in promoting increases in fish and coral populations and identified key ecological and environmental factors that influence reef community structure and potentially protection success. From 2009 to 2013, we annually surveyed 16 reefs in Belize, including 8 MPA sites (where ex tractive fishing is limited or prohibited) and 8 unprotected sites. At each site, we quantified the biomass of reef fishes, coral and macroalgal cover, and several biotic and abiotic variables that are known to affect reef inhabitants. High predatory reef fish and parrotfish biomass values were associated with high reef structural complexity and low wave exposure. Mean macroalgal cover was negatively associated with parrotfish biomass in 1 protected zone. However, mean macroalgal cover remained above 40% across all sites, and no change in coral cover was observed during the study. Our results indicate that fisheries restrictions alone do not lead to increases in coral cover even when successful for fishes. We speculate that both illegal and legal fishing may be compromising Belize's MPA network goals. Furthermore, we suggest that species composition as well as local environmental conditions play key roles in coral reef recovery and should be considered when evaluating management strategies.

We examined potential factors affecting this seasonal pattern of distribution by counting short-tailed shearwaters from boats. Their main prey, krill, was sampled by net tows in the southeastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands and in the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea. Short-tailed shearwaters were mainly distributed in the southeastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (60 +/- 473 birds km(-2)) in July 2013, and in the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea (19 +/- 91 birds km(-2)) in September 2012. In the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea, krill size was greater in September 2012 (9.6 +/- 5.0 mm in total length) than in July 2013 (1.9 +/- 1.2 mm). Within the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea in September 2012, short-tailed shearwaters occurred more frequently in cells (50 +/- 50 km) where large-sized krill were more abundant. These findings, and information previously collected in other studies, suggest that the seasonal northward movement of short-tailed shearwaters might be associated with the seasonal increase in krill size in the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea. We could not, however, rule out the possibility that large interannual variation in krill abundance might influence the seasonal distribution of shearwaters. This study highlights the importance of krill, which is advected from the Pacific, as an important prey of top predators in the Arctic marine ecosystem.

K.; Hoyberget, Magne			Traces of an ancient immune system - how an injured arthropod survived 465 million years ago	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CRAYFISH EYE; TRILOBITE; ORDOVICIAN; MECHANISMS; REFLECTION; REPAIR	This report of a severely injured trilobite from the Middle Ordovician (similar to 465 Ma) accords with a number of similar observations of healed lesions observed in trilobites. The uniqueness of the specimen described here is that the character of the repair-mechanisms is reflected by the secondarily built structures, which form the new surface of the ruptured compound eye. Smooth, repaired areas inside the visual surface advert to a clotting principle, rather similar to those of today, and the way in which broken parts of the exoskeleton fused during restoration seem to simulate modern samples. The irregularity and variance of newly inserted visual units indicate the severity of the injury, which, most probably, was caused by a predatory attack, presumably by a cephalopod; these were most likely, the top predators of the Ordovician. Furthermore, the state of the moulted cephalon tells the dramatic struggle of an organism that lived in the Palaeozoic, to survive. In sum the specimen analysed here is evidence of an ancient clotting mechanism not dissimilar to those of today, rapidly preventing any exsanguination and the breakdown of osmoregulation of this marine arthropod.

Potential for cumulative effects of human stressors on fish, sea birds and marine mammals in Arctic waters	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Human activities; Multiple stressors; Cumulative impacts; Biodiversity; Ecosystem-based management; Arctic; Greenland	HUMAN PRESSURES; IMPACT; ECOSYSTEMS; BAY	We estimate the potential for cumulative impacts from multiple anthropogenic stressors on fish, sea birds, and marine mammals in the western, southern and south-eastern parts of marine waters around Greenland. The analysis is based on a comprehensive data set representing five human activities including two proxies for climate change, as well as 25 key animal species including commercially important fish and top predators such as sea birds and marine mammals. Anthropogenic stressors are concentrated in two areas: the offshore waters south of Greenland, and especially the western coast from the Qeqertarsuaq (Disko Island) area to the southern tip of Greenland. The latter is also an area of high importance for many key species, thus the potential for cumulative impacts is high along Greenland's west coast. We conclude that this area should be under high scientific scrutiny and conservation attention.

California Multivariate Ocean Climate Indicator (MOCI) and marine ecosystem dynamics	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Coastal upwelling; Climate variability; California marine ecosystem; Biophysical relationships; Temperature	NORTHEAST PACIFIC; OSCILLATION; VARIABILITY; ATLANTIC; IMPACTS; ESTUARY; INDEX; ENSO; DIET; BAY	Marine ecosystems are complex adaptive systems with physical and biological processes operating on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present an operational regional indicator for California's continental shelf system and investigate its skill in predicting a variety of biological responses across trophic levels. This updated Multivariate Ocean Climate Indicator (MOCI) version 2 includes data that are readily available from the Internet so the indicator can be automatically updated and shared regularly. MOCIv.2 is a simplified version of MOCIv.1, but it captures ocean-climate variability similarly. MOCIv.2 illustrates all major ENSO events that occurred over the past 25 years as well as the phasing and magnitude of the most recent North Pacific marine heat wave, dubbed 'The Blob'. It also shows differences in the magnitude and timing of ocean-climate variability in different regions off California. MOCIv.2 has skill in nowcasting marine ecosystem dynamics, from zooplankton to top predators, and therefore may be useful in establishing bio-physical relationships important to ecosystem-based fisheries and wildlife management in California.

Invertebrates play important and diverse functional roles in marine ecosystems, yet the ecosystem effects of their exploitation are poorly understood. Using 12 ecosystem models distributed worldwide, we analysed the trade-offs of various invertebrate fisheries and their ecosystem effects as well as ecological indicators. Although less recognized for their contributions to marine food webs, our results show that the magnitude of trophic impacts of invertebrates on other species of commercial and conservation interest is comparable with those of forage fish. Generally, cephalopods showed the strongest ecosystem effects and were characterized by a strong top-down predatory role. Lobster, and to a lesser extent, crabs, shrimp and prawns, also showed strong ecosystem effects, but at lower trophic levels. Benthic invertebrates, including epifauna and infauna, also showed considerable ecosystem effects, but with strong bottom-up characteristics. In contrast, urchins, bivalves, and gastropods showed generally lower ecosystem effects in our simulations. Invertebrates also strongly contributed to benthic-pelagic coupling, with exploitation of benthic invertebrates impacting pelagic fishes and vice versa. Finally, on average, invertebrates produced maximum sustainable yield at lower levels of depletion (similar to 45%) than forage fish (similar to 65%), highlighting the need for management targets that avoid negative consequences for target species and marine ecosystems as a whole.

J	Kenchington, TJ				Kenchington, Trevor J.			Implications of fish migration and fishing mortality for marine protected area design	FISH AND FISHERIES			English	Article						depletion; fish migration; marine protected area; optimal fishing	MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE-YIELD; NATURAL MORTALITY; TROPHIC CASCADES; ECOSYSTEM; FISHERIES; SIZE; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; PREDATORS; COD	The Convention on Biological Diversity calls for networks of 'representative' MPAs, the effectiveness of which requires that the protected ecosystems be independent of external anthropogenic pressures. One principal pressure, fishing, severely depletes the oldest age classes of the target fish even if optimally managed. As many fishery resource species had high natural abundance and large individual sizes, while most fish show indeterminate growth and ascend the trophic pyramid as they grow, elimination of older age classes equates to removal of once-dominant top predators. Because archetypal resource species are also migratory, that loss is transported throughout the range of the exploited populations, including into MPAs, through a lack of large migrants. The ecological implications remain uncertain in marine ecosystems, which are typically under 'bottom-up' control. 'Top-down'effects, such as mesopredator release, species replacement and trophic cascades, have been observed, however, meaning that elimination of top predators may affect ecosystem structure. It follows that, while exceptions doubtless exist, in general 'representative' MPAs should not be expected to fulfil their declared purposes, unless they are made so large as to encompass the whole migratory circuits of principal resource species - implying indefinite closure of the fisheries affected. Some compromise may be possible if MPAs were combined with fishing mortality rates far below current 'optimal' levels or where fishing can be concentrated on younger adults, while older fish are protected from exploitation. In any case, societies must choose between seafood production and recovery of selected marine areas to near-pristine conditions.

This was, however, not the first fjord this jellyfish invaded, and data suggest that it will not be the last one, either. With warmer temperatures, the jellyfish is moving northward in Norway, but not all fjords are created equal, and it is not thriving or taking up residence just anywhere. The current article explores three fjords in which Periphylla periphylla has become the top predator and outcompeted former ones. The main question of interest is why the jellyfish becomes dominant in one fjord and not another. The next question is which other Norwegian fjords further north exist with similar characteristics where we therefore would expect Periphylla periphylla to proliferate in the future. The latter is important from a policy and adaptation perspective for the local community of people, since the proliferation of the species unmistakably leads to fewer fish for commercial harvest and potentially less attractive waters for tourism purposes. Results show that three northern fjords, the Skjerstadfjorden the Holandsfjorden, and Stordjupna in the Vestfjord appear to be particularly vulnerable to a future Periphylla periphylla invasion.

Scale of inference: on the sensitivity of habitat models for wide-ranging marine predators to the resolution of environmental data	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CALIFORNIA CURRENT SYSTEM; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTHEAST PACIFIC; TELEMETRY DATA; DYNAMIC OCEAN; TOP PREDATOR; GRAIN-SIZE; SEA	Understanding and predicting the responses of wide-ranging marine predators such as cetaceans, seabirds, sharks, turtles, pinnipeds and large migratory fish to dynamic oceanographic conditions requires habitat-based models that can sufficiently capture their environmental preferences. Marine ecosystems are inherently dynamic, and animal-environment interactions are known to occur over multiple, nested spatial and temporal scales. The spatial resolution and temporal averaging of environmental data layers are therefore key considerations in modelling the environmental determinants of habitat selection. The utility of environmental data contemporaneous to animal presence or movement (e.g. daily, weekly), versus synoptic products (monthly, seasonal, climatological) is currently debated, as are the trade-offs between near real-time, high resolution and composite (i.e. synoptic, cloud-free) data fields. Using movement simulations with built-in environmental preferences in combination with both modelled and remotely-sensed (ROMS, MODIS-Aqua) sea surface temperature (SST) fields, we explore the effects of spatial and temporal resolution (3-111 km, daily-climatological) in predictive habitat models. Results indicate that models fitted using seasonal or climatological data fields can introduce bias in presence-availability designs based upon animal movement datasets, particularly in highly dynamic oceanographic domains. These effects were pronounced where models were constructed using seasonal or climatological fields of coarse (>0.25 degree) spatial resolution. However, cloud obstruction can lead to significant information loss in remotely-sensed data fields. We found that model accuracy decreased substantially above 70% data loss. In cloudy regions, weekly or monthly environmental data fields may therefore be preferable. These findings have important implications for marine resource management, particularly in identifying key habitats for populations of conservation concern, and in forecasting climate-mediated ecosystem changes.

Mercury can have serious deleterious effects on a variety of organisms, with top predators being particularly susceptible because methylmercury bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in food webs. Among birds, seabirds can have especially high levels of Hg contamination and Leach's storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), in particular, have amongst the highest known levels. Several populations of Leach's storm-petrels have declined recently in the Northwest Atlantic. The causes of these declines remain uncertain, but the toxic effects of Hg could be a potential factor in this decline. Here, we tested for relationships between adult blood total Hg (THg) concentration and several offspring development parameters, and adult return rate of Leach's storm-petrels breeding on Bon Portage Island (43A degrees 28' N, 65A degrees 44' W), Nova Scotia, Canada, between 2011 and 2015 (blood samples n = 20, 36, 6, 15, and 13 for each year, respectively). Overall, THg levels were elevated (0.78 +/- 0.43 mu g/g wet wt.) compared to other species of seabirds in this region, and varied significantly among years. However, we found no associations between THg levels and reproductive parameters or adult return rate. Our results indicate that levels of mercury observed in Leach's storm-petrel blood, although elevated, appear not to adversely affect their offspring development or adult return rate on Bon Portage Island.

A test of trophic cascade theory: fish and benthic assemblages across a predator density gradient on coral reefs	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Community ecology; Fishing; Herbivory; Marine protected areas; Top-down effects	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; HERBIVORE BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGICAL ROLE; APEX PREDATORS; FOOD WEBS; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; STRENGTH; DIFFERENTIATION	Removal of predators is often hypothesized to alter community structure through trophic cascades. However, despite recent advances in our understanding of trophic cascades, evidence is often circumstantial on coral reefs because fishing pressure frequently co-varies with other anthropogenic effects, such as fishing for herbivorous fishes and changes in water quality due to pollution. Australia's outer Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has experienced fishing-induced declines of apex predators and mesopredators, but pollution and targeting of herbivorous fishes are minimal. Here, we quantify fish and benthic assemblages across a fishing-induced predator density gradient on the outer GBR, including apex predators and mesopredators to herbivores and benthic assemblages, to test for evidence of trophic cascades and alternative hypotheses to trophic cascade theory. Using structural equation models, we found no cascading effects from apex predators to lower trophic levels: a loss of apex predators did not lead to higher levels of mesopredators, and this did not suppress mobile herbivores and drive algal proliferation. Likewise, we found no effects of mesopredators on lower trophic levels: a decline of mesopredators was not associated with higher abundances of algae-farming damselfishes and algae-dominated reefs. These findings indicate that top-down forces on coral reefs are weak, at least on the outer GBR. We conclude that predator-mediated trophic cascades are probably the exception rather than the rule in complex ecosystems such as the outer GBR.

Here, we present the case of Thalassiosira curviseriata, a winter-blooming diatom in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina, which displayed a noticeable decrease in the past decade along with conspicuous changes in phenology. We compiled interannual field data to assess compound effects of environmental variations and grazing by the invasive copepod Eurytemora americana. The two species displayed opposite trends over the period examined. The diatom decreased toward the last years, mainly during the winters, and remained relatively constant over the other seasons, while the copepod increased toward the last years, with an occurrence restricted to winter and early spring. A quantitative assessment by structural equation modeling unveiled that the observed long-term trend of T. curviseriata resulted from the synergistic effects of environmental changes driven by water temperature, salinity, and grazing. These results suggest that the shift in the abundance distribution of T. curviseriata toward higher annual ranges of temperature and salinity-as displayed by habitat association curves-constitutes a functional response to avoid seasonal overlapping with its predator in late winters.

Consumer versus resource control and the importance of habitat heterogeneity for estuarine bivalves	OIKOS			English	Article							DENSITY-DEPENDENT PREDATION; CRABS CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS; MACOMA-BALTHICA; BLUE CRABS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CHESAPEAKE BAY; WADDEN SEA; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; EXPLOITATION ECOSYSTEMS	The relative influence of consumers (top down) and resources (bottom up) on the distribution and abundance of organisms remains a key question in ecology. We examined the relationships between consumer and resource variables along a productivity gradient for a dominant predator-prey interaction in a marine soft-sediment system. We 1) quantified density and size of the clam Macoma balthica (prey species) in six replicate sites at each of four habitat types (shallow mud, deep mud, muddy sand and detrital mud) in the Rhode River, Chesapeake Bay. We selected one habitat type of high food availability and clam density (shallow mud) and another of low food availability and clam density (muddy sand) for manipulative experiments. Then, we 2) measured M. balthica survival and growth through transplants, 3) measured food availability as sedimentary organic carbon content, 4) quantified predator density, and 5) calculated predator foraging efficiency in the two habitat types. Clam density in the four habitat types differed and was related to sedimentary carbon availability and predator density. One of the habitats, detrital mud, appeared to be a population sink because it only held juvenile Macoma that never survived to reproductive age. Macoma size and growth, and predator (mainly blue crab Callinectes sapidus) densities were positively correlated with productivity and were higher in shallow mud than muddy sand. In contrast, Macoma mortality, local 'interaction strength', and predator foraging efficiency were lower in the productive habitat (shallow mud). Thus, predation intensity was inversely correlated with productivity (food availability); consumer and resource effects differed by habitat type; and, at a relatively small spatial scale, consumer and resource forces jointly determined population dynamics in this soft-sediment marine system.

Stranded marine mammals have been a particularly useful resource to discover and comprehend the diseases that plague these top predators. Additionally, advancements in high-throughut sequencing (HTS) has contributed to the diseovery of novel pathogens in marine mammals. in this study, we use a combination of HTS and stranded harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) to better understand a known and unknown brain disease. To do this, we used transcriptomics to evaluate brain tissues from seven neonatal harbor seals that expired from an unknown cause of death (UCD) and compared them to four neonatal harbor seals that had confirmed Phocine herpesvirus (PhV-1) infections in the brain. Comparing the two disease states we found that UCD animals showed a significant abundance of fatty acid metabolic transcripts in their brain tissue,speculate that a fatty acid metabolic dysregulation contributed to the death of these animals. Furthermore, we were able to describe the response of four young harbor seals with PhV-1 infections in the brain. PhV-1 infected animals shoved a significant ability to mount an innate and adaptive immune response, especially to combat viral infections. Our data also suggests that PhV-1 can hijack host pathways for DNA packaging and exocvtsis. This is the first study to use transcriptomics in marine mammals to understand host an viral interactionstions and assess the death of stranded marine mammals with unknown disease. Furthermore, we show the value of applying transcriptomics on stranded marine mammals for disease characterization.	[Rosales, Stephanie M.; Thurber, Rebecca L.

Origin of Sulfur in Diet Drives Spatial and Temporal Mercury Trends in Seabird Eggs From Pacific Canada 1968-2015	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; STABLE-ISOTOPES; NORTH-AMERICA; METHYLMERCURY CONCENTRATIONS; REGIONAL DIFFERENCES; SULFATE STIMULATION; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; MUSEUM SPECIMENS; GULL DIET; ACID-RAIN	Mercury (Hg) is a neurotoxin that can be particularly harmful to top predators because it biomagnifies through the food web. Due to variation in the food web structure, variation in Hg exposure in predators may represent variation in diet rather than Hg availability. We measured Hg in eggs from six seabird species (N = 537) over 47 years. In contrast to expectation, storm-petrels feeding partially on invertebrates had the highest Hg burden while herons feeding on large fish had the lowest Hg burden. A multiple regression showed that Hg correlated with delta S-34 (R-2 = 0.86) rather than trophic level (delta N-15 of "trophic" amino acids). Sulfate-rich environments (high delta S-34) have sulfate-reducing bacteria that produce methylmercury. Variation in Hg within and among seabirds near the top of the food web was associated with variation in delta S-34 at the base of the food web more so than trophic position within the food web. Hg levels in seabirds only changed over time for those species where delta S-34 also varied in tandem; after accounting for diet (delta S-34), there was no variation in Hg levels. Variation in Hg in seabirds across space and time was associated with the origin of sulfur in the diet.

This is especially important as climate change, pollution, and overfishing change the structure and functioning of pelagic ecosystems. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical spatial-temporal models to map the Essential Fish Habitats of the Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the waters around Isla del Coco National Park, Pacific Costa Rica, based on independent underwater observations from 1993 to 2013. We assessed if observed changes in the distribution and abundance of this species are related with habitat characteristics, fishing intensity or more extreme climatic events, including the El Nino Southern Oscillation, and changes on the average sea surface temperature. Yellowfin tuna showed a decreasing abundance trend in the sampled period, whereas higher abundances were found in shallow and warmer waters, with high concentration of chlorophyll- a, and in surrounding seamounts. In addition, El Nino Southern Oscillation events did not seem to affect Yellowfin tuna distribution and abundance. Understanding the habitat preferences of this species, using approaches as the one developed here, may help design integrated programs for more efficient management of vulnerable species.

Yet, some species might performunique functional roles while others are redundant. Thus, the benefits of high species richness in maintaining ecosystem functioning are uncertain if functions have little redundancy, potentially leading to high vulnerability of functions. We studied the natural propensity of assemblages to be functionally buffered against loss prior to fishing activities, using functional trait combinations, in coral reef fish assemblages across unfished wilderness areas of the Indo-Pacific: Chagos Archipelago, New Caledonia and French Polynesia. Fish functional diversity in these wilderness areas is highly vulnerable to fishing, explained by species-and abundance-based redundancy packed into a small combination of traits, leaving most other trait combinations (60%) sensitive to fishing, with no redundancy. Functional vulnerability peaks for mobile and sedentary top predators, and large species in general. Functional vulnerability decreases for certain functional entities in New Caledonia, where overall functional redundancy was higher. Uncovering these baseline patterns of functional vulnerability can offer early warning signals of the damaging effects from fishing, and may serve as baselines to guide precautionary and even proactive conservation actions.

This native carnivore is classified as Vulnerable in the Red Book of Terrestrial Vertebrates of Chile. Between September and November 2004 we assessed their diet through fecal analysis and records of food remnants. We used a quantitative overlap index to test for coincidental similarity between the 2 analyses, and also we applied a survey to fisherfolks at Caleta El Manzano de Pucatrihue, southern Chile, to learn about the perception they have of L. felina impact on local fishing. Based on an analysis of 35 faeces the diet was represented by 60.8% of crustaceans, 32.4% of fishes and 6.7% of shellfishes presences. Of 150 food remnants the prey corresponds to 55.3% of crustaceans, 44.0% of molluscs and 0.7% of birds. The two analyses carried out had a slow similarity (= 0.35 +/- 0.22). L. felina preys on resources exploited by artisanal fishing, but fishing gears are not damaged by this marine mammal. A 66.7% of the fishermen said that otters not affect their fishing, while 30.0% said the opposite; holding as cause the consumption by L. felina on the same resources exploited by them (e.g., Concholepas concholepas). Although this mammal does not cause significant damage to local fisheries still exists at present, however, illegal hunting of this otter in the study area. The reasons for this action ranging from the sale of their skin until his killing by a simple recreation.

Food provisioning increases the risk of injury in a long-lived marine top predator	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						anthropogenic disturbance; behaviour; dolphin; human exposure; Sarasota; wildlife management	BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; RECREATIONAL FISHING GEAR; TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS; SARASOTA BAY; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; CUMULATIVE EXPOSURE; HUMAN-SETTLEMENTS; WILDLIFE TOURISM; FLORIDA; BEHAVIOR	Food provisioning of wildlife is a major concern for management and conservation agencies worldwide because it encourages unnatural behaviours in wild animals and increases each individual's risk for injury and death. Here we investigate the contributing factors and potential fitness consequences of a recent increase in the frequency of human interactions with common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Sarasota Bay, Florida. A rising proportion of the local long-term resident dolphin community is becoming conditioned to human interactions through direct and indirect food provisioning. We investigate variables that are affecting conditioning and if the presence of human-induced injuries is higher for conditioned versus unconditioned dolphins. Using the most comprehensive long-term dataset available for a free-ranging bottlenose dolphin population (more than 45 years; more than 32000 dolphin group sightings; more than 1100 individuals), we found that the association with already conditioned animals strongly affected the probability of dolphins becoming conditioned to human interactions, confirming earlier findings that conditioning is partly a learned behaviour. More importantly, we found that conditioned dolphins were more likely to be injured by human interactions when compared with unconditioned animals. This is alarming, as conditioning could lead to a decrease in survival, which could have population-level consequences. We did not find a significant relationship between human exposure or natural prey availability and the probability of dolphins becoming conditioned. This could be due to low sample size or insufficient spatio-temporal resolution in the available data. Our findings show that wildlife provisioning may lead to a decrease in survival, which could ultimately affect population dynamics.

The effects of sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) on abalone (Haliotis spp.) is a salient example along North America's west coast where sea otters are recovering from 18th- and 19th-century fur trade while efforts are being made to recover abalone from more recent overfishing. To understand the direct and indirect effects of sea otters on northern abalone (H. kamtschatkana) and the relative influence of biotic and abiotic conditions, we surveyed subtidal rocky reef sites varying in otter occupation time in three regions of British Columbia, Canada. Sites occupied by sea otters for over 30 years had 16 times lower densities of exposed abalone than sites where otters have yet to recover (0.46 +/- 0.08/20 m(2) vs. 7.56 +/- 0.98/20 m(2)), but they also had higher densities of cryptic abalone (2.17 +/- 1.31/20 m(2) vs. 1.31 +/- 0.20/20 m(2)). Abalone densities were greater in deeper vs. shallower habitats at sites with sea otters compared to sites without otters. Sea otter effects on exposed abalone density were three times greater in magnitude than those of any other factor, whereas substrate and wave exposure effects on cryptic abalone were six times greater than those of sea otters. While higher substrate complexity may benefit abalone by providing refugia from sea otter predation, laboratory experiments revealed that it may also lead to higher capture efficiency by sunflower stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), a ubiquitous mesopredator, compared to habitat with lower complexity. Sea otter recovery indirectly benefitted abalone by decreasing biomass of predatory sunflower stars and competitive grazing sea urchins, while increasing stipe density and depth of kelp that provides food and protective habitat. Importantly, abalone persisted in the face of sea otter recovery, albeit at lower densities of smaller and more cryptic individuals. We provide empirical evidence of how complex ecological interactions influence the effects of recovering predators on their recovering prey.

Cascading effects of predation risk determine how marine predators become terrestrial prey on an oceanic island	ECOLOGY			English	Article						apex predators; barn owls; deer mice; giving up densities; indirect interactions; mesopredators; murrelets; predation; risk effects; seabirds; trophic cascade	MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; INVASIVE SPECIES REMOVAL; MESOPREDATOR RELEASE; DEER MICE; PEROMYSCUS-MANICULATUS; TROPHIC CASCADES; ALIEN PREDATORS; FOOD-CHAIN; BARN OWLS; PATCH USE	Apex predators can suppress the foraging activity of mesopredators, which may then result in cascading benefits for the prey of those mesopredators. We studied the interactions between a top predator, the Barn Owl (Tyto alba), and their primary prey, an island endemic deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus elusus), which in turn consumes the eggs of seabirds nesting on Santa Barbara Island in California. Scripps's Murrelets (Synthliboramphus scrippsi), a threatened nocturnal seabird, arrive annually to breed on this island, and whose first egg is particularly vulnerable to predation by mice. We took advantage of naturally occurring extreme variations in the density of mice and owls on the island over 3 years and predicted that (1) mouse foraging would decrease with increasing predation risk from owls and moonlight and (2) these decreases in foraging would reduce predation on murrelet eggs. We measured the giving up densities of mice with experimental foraging stations and found that mice were sensitive to predation risk and foraged less when owls were more abundant and less during the full moon compared to the new moon. We also monitored the fates of 151 murrelet eggs, and found that murrelet egg predation declined as owl abundance increased, and was lower during the full moon compared to the new moon. Moreover, high owl abundance suppressed egg predation even when mice were extremely abundant. We conclude that there is a behaviorally mediated cascade such that owls on the island had a positive indirect effect on murrelet egg survival. Our study adds to the wider recognition of the strength of risk effects to structure food webs, as well as highlighting the complex ways that marine and terrestrial food webs can intersect.

In this study, we used variations in predator biomass between management zones on the Great Barrier Reef to examine how predators influence the biomass, mortality, condition, and reproductive potential of a common prey species Scolopsis bilineatus (bridled monocle bream; Nemipteridae). Despite no numerical differences in biomass or mortality, we found significant differences in a variety of demographic traits for S. bilineatus between multiple areas of high and low predator biomass. The size-at-age, condition, and reproductive potential of fish were reduced in marine reserves where predator biomass was high. The response of fish to predators was highly sex dependent; females suffered the greatest reductions in condition and reproductive potential. This study supports the notion that predators can play important roles in regulating prey dynamics and emphasises the importance of understanding top-down control by predators when considering fisheries management techniques and conservation strategies.

Towards a balanced presentation and objective interpretation of acoustic and trawl survey data, with specific reference to the eastern Scotian Shelf	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							POLLOCK THERAGRA-CHALCOGRAMMA; COD GADUS-MORHUA; LAKE-SUPERIOR; ATLANTIC COD; NORTHWEST ATLANTIC; BOTTOM TRAWL; ST-LAWRENCE; PHYTOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; BERING-SEA	A debate has developed over the ecosystem consequences following the collapse of Atlantic cod throughout the coastal waters of eastern Canada. The explosive increase in pelagic fish abundance in scientific bottom-trawl catches on the eastern Scotian Shelf has been interpreted as being due to either (i) a "pelagic outburst" of forage fish abundance resulting from predator release or conversely (ii) a change in pelagic fish vertical distribution leading to a "suprabenthic habitat occupation" thereby increasing their availability to bottom trawls. These two interpretations have diametrically opposing ecological consequences and suggest different management strategies for these important forage fish species. We argue that an objective evaluation of the available evidence supports the hypothesis that the abundance of forage fish has not increased in response to the demise of cod and other top predators, and the reliance on a single sampling gear with low catchability has biased and will continue to bias the interpretation of demographic trends of pelagic fish populations. We advocate that multiple sampling technologies providing alternative perspectives are needed for the monitoring and management of the various trophic levels if we are to achieve a balanced and objective understanding of marine ecosystems.

Jellyfish were long considered as 'dead ends' within food webs, and therefore overlooked as potential food source for higher trophic levels, e.g. fishes. Here this question is tackled by using comprehensive laboratory experiments assessing fish predation on jellyfish. The approach included all the life stages (polyps, ephyrae and medusa) of Aurelia sp. versus more traditional aquaculture feeds in an easily farmed opportunistic fish, the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata (L.). Results revealed that all life stages of Aurelia sp. were accepted as a source of food by S. aurata, whose grazing pressure varies depending on the jellyfish life stage. Higher ingestion rates were observed on young stages (i.e. small medusa) indicating their higher vulnerability to fish predation and the potential negative impact this may have on Aurelia sp. population dynamics. These results provide new insights on the so far underestimated role fish predation can have on jellyfish population dynamics. In particular, opportunistic fish species, such as S. aurata may contribute to control jellyfish blooms, through top-down regulations of jellyfish biomass. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, such measurements are critical if we are to understand how variation in foraging efficiency, and in turn individual body condition, is impacted by environmentally driven changes in prey abundance and/or accessibility. To investigate the influence of oceanographic habitat type on foraging efficiency, ten post-breeding female southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina (SES) were equipped and tracked with bio-loggers to give continuous information of prey catch attempts, body density and body activity. Variations in these indices of foraging efficiency were then compared between three different oceanographic habitats, delineated by the main frontal structures of the Southern Ocean. Results show that changes in body density are related not only to the number of previous prey catch attempts and to the body activity (at a 6 day lag), but also foraging habitat type. For example, despite a lower daily prey catch attempt rate, SESs foraging north of the sub-Antarctic front improve their body density at a higher rate than individuals foraging south of the sub-Antarctic and polar fronts, suggesting that they may forage on easier to catch and/or more energetically rich prey in this area. Our study highlights a need to understand the influence of habitat type on top predator foraging behaviour and efficiency when attempting a better comprehension of marine ecosystems.

This approach consisted in forcing a high trophic level model (OSMOSE) with an existing biogeochemical model (Eco3M-MED) representing the seasonal dynamics of the low trophic levels. The two models were linked through trophic interactions to represent the ecosystem dynamics from primary producers to top predators. In this study, we developed the multispecies, individual-based model OSMOSE in the Gulf of Gabes (OSMOSE-GoG). This model aims to capture the main processes that influence species life cycle and simulate the functioning of the ecosystem according to opportunistic predation process based on size selection and spatio-temporal co-occurrence between a predator and its prey. The spatial distribution of the eleven modelled species was derived from a Multi-Scale Species Distribution Modelling approach. We calibrated OSMOSE-GoG model with available data of biomass and fishing yield, using an optimization method based on evolutionary algorithms which is suitable for complex and stochastic models. Finally, OSMOSE-GoG was validated against independent data sets at different hierarchical levels: the individual (diet composition), population (mean size of commercial catch) and community levels (mean trophic level) following the Pattern-Oriented Modelling approach. The model outputs were overall consistent with the diet compositions and mean trophic levels derived from the ECOPATH model of the Gulf of Gabes (ECOPATH-GoG) and the observations of mean size of catches. The OSMOSE-GoG can be considered as a baseline Model to investigate ecosystem responses to environmental changes and fishing management measures in the Gulf of Gabes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Trophic cascade effects have shown predator mediated changes in primary production, but we predict that predators should lower the overall biomass capacity of any system with top down control. Through a simple Bayesian belief network model of a typical marine foodweb, we show that predator removal, as is common through activities such as fishing and shark finning, results in higher biomasses of lower trophic level fish and zooplankton, resulting in higher net carbon production by the system. In situations common throughout much of the ocean, where activities such as shark finning and over fishing reduce the highest tropic levels, the probability of net carbon production increasing in the model was similar to 60%, and unlike previous studies on simple food chains, trophic cascade effects were not present. While the results are preliminary, and sources of uncertainty in data and models are acknowledged, such results provide even more strength to the argument to protect open sea fish stocks, and particularly large predators such as sharks, cetaceans and game fish.

All were tagged at Heard Island in the Southern Ocean over a single summer season collecting over 5000 tracking days for 178 individuals. We aimed to predict areas of likely high foraging value from tracking environmental data and also to quantify overlap in foraging range between species. Hidden Markov models were used to differentiate between bouts of Area Restricted Search (ARS) assumed to be associated with areas of higher foraging value, and transit behaviours. Oceanographic and distance metrics associated with ARS activity were then used to calculate a habitat electivity index. A combined bootstrap/Monte Carlo scheme was employed to propagate uncertainty from the Hidden Markov models into the habitat prediction scheme. Distinct differences were predicted in the spatial distribution of foraging locations in different species, reflecting different dispersive abilities and foraging strategy. The extent of usage and foraging distribution was largely contained within Australian the Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ). In comparison, the smaller Australian Commonwealth Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) contained <20% of the predicted foraging distributions. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Global population genetic dynamics of a highly migratory, apex predator shark	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						genetic population structure; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; tiger shark	SEX-BIASED DISPERSAL; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; TIGER SHARKS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; HABITAT USE; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; AUSTRALIAN WATERS	Knowledge of genetic connectivity dynamics in the world's large-bodied, highly migratory, apex predator sharks across their global ranges is limited. One such species, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), occurs worldwide in warm temperate and tropical waters, uses remarkably diverse habitats (nearshore to pelagic) and possesses a generalist diet that can structure marine ecosystems through top-down processes. We investigated the phylogeography and the global population structure of this exploited, phylogenetically enigmatic shark by using 10 nuclear microsatellites (n = 380) and sequences from the mitochondrial control region (CR, n = 340) and cytochrome oxidase I gene (n = 100). All three marker classes showed the genetic differentiation between tiger sharks from the western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific ocean basins (microsatellite F-ST > 0.129; CR Phi(ST) > 0.497), the presence of North vs. southwestern Atlantic differentiation and the isolation of tiger sharks sampled from Hawaii from other surveyed locations. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA revealed high levels of intraocean basin matrilineal population structure, suggesting female philopatry and sex-biased gene flow. Coalescent-and genetic distance-based estimates of divergence from CR sequences were largely congruent (d(corr) = 0.0015-0.0050), indicating a separation of Indo-Pacific and western Atlantic tiger sharks <1 million years ago. Mitochondrial haplotype relationships suggested that the western South Atlantic Ocean was likely a historical connection for interocean basin linkages via the dispersal around South Africa. Together, the results reveal unexpectedly high levels of population structure in a highly migratory, behaviourally generalist, cosmopolitan ocean predator, calling for management and conservation on smaller-than-anticipated spatial scales.

In recent years, the removal of these individuals from upper trophic levels as a result of overfishing has negatively affected ecosystems. We analysed the diet of blue sharks (Prionace glauca) caught off the west coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico, during the months of February-June in 2001, 2005 and 2006. We employed both stomach content and stable isotope analyses as each method provides distinct yet important information regarding the role of blue sharks in marine food webs, allowing us to estimate the relative contribution of different prey items to this predator's diet. Of the 368 stomachs analysed, 210 contained food (57%) and 158 (43%) were empty. Based on stomach contents and the index of relative importance (IRI), the pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) was the most important prey, followed by the squids Gonatus californiensis (34.1%) and Ancistrocheirus lesueurii (10.4%). The mean (+/- SD) values for delta N-15 (16.48 +/- 0.94%) and delta C-13 (-18.48 +/- 0.63%) suggest that blue sharks prefer feeding in oceanic waters. The trophic level based on stomach content analysis was 4.05, while that based on the stable isotope analysis was 3.8, making blue sharks top consumers in the marine ecosystem of Baja California Sur, Mexico.

Here, we examine how predation can regulate fouling communities on artificial substrates in the coast of Brazil. Specifically, we tested whether predators limit colonization and establishment of introduced species. A predation experiment using plastic plates as experimental replicates (predator excluded and not excluded) was carried out in Ceara, Bahia, So Paulo and Santa Catarina, between 3A degrees S and 27A degrees S. Ninety-eight species colonized the plates, 14 of which were introduced. While species richness was similar among the treatments (except in Santa Catarina), community structure varied by treatment and introduced species were less abundant in the predation treatment at all sites. Also, predation was selective and controlled introduced, poorly defended, species, specifically ascidians. Thus, biotic resistance driven by predation was not ubiquitous but apparently targets one group of major economic and environmental impact. As a consequence, introduced barnacles were released from competition with dominant ascidians and thus the ecosystem service (biotic resistance) performed by fish alone was unable to completely avoid or control the introduction of non-native species. Control measures must rely on various approaches, but if we want fish to contribute in this control, it is very important to conserve the local native assembly of predators in order to reap their benefits in this ecosystem service.

However the effects are strongly dependent on regional predator pools, which can drive predation risk in habitats with very similar structure in opposite directions. In the Mediterranean Sea predation on juvenile sea urchins is commonly known to be regulated by seagrass structure. In this study we test whether the possibility for juvenile Paracentrotus lividus to be predated changes in relation to the fragmentation of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica (four habitat classes: continuous, low-fragmentation, high-fragmentation and rocks), and to the spatial arrangement of such habitat classes at a landscape scale. Sea urchin predation risk was measured in a 20-day field experiment on tethered individuals placed in three square areas 35x35 m(2) in size. Variability of both landscape and habitat structural attributes was assessed at the sampling grain 5x5 m(2). Predation risk changed among landscapes, as it was lower where more 'rocks', and thus less seagrass, were present. The higher risk was found in the 'continuous' P. oceanica rather than in the low-fragmentation, high-fragmentation and rock habitats (p-values = 0.0149, 0.00008, and 0.0001, respectively). Therefore, the expectation that juvenile P. lividus survival would have been higher in the 'continuous' seagrass habitat, which would have served as shelter from high fish predation pressure, was not met. Predation risk changed across habitats due to different success between attack types: benthic attacks (mostly from whelks) were overall much more effective than those due to fish activity, the former type being associated with the 'continuous' seagrass habitat. Fish predation on juvenile sea urchins on rocks and 'high-fragmentation' habitat was less likely than benthic predation in the 'continuous' seagrass, with the low seagrass patch complexity increasing benthic activity. Future research should be aimed at investigating, derived from the complex indirect interactions among species, how top-down control in marine reserves can modify seagrass habitat effects.

The nutritional value of the sandeel is linked to the presence of lipid-rich zooplankton species, which makes their trophic role vulnerable to climate-induced changes in the zooplankton community. We provide the first description of diet and lipid accumulation of the northern sand lance Ammodytes dubius Reinhardt, 1837 in southwest Greenland (64 degrees N) during a growing season. Sampling occurred in May, August and September 2013, and differences in diet and lipid content were found in relation to season, gender and ontogeny. In terms of numbers and biomass, nauplii constituted the vast majority of prey in May, whereas copepods (primarily large Calanus spp.) dominated in August and September. Groups of larger prey (euphausiids and amphipods) were only found late in the season and primarily in sandeel larger than 16 cm. Mean lipid content (% DW) was at a minimum in May for both mature (males: 5.6%, females: 6.4%) and immature sandeel (3.9%), and peaked in August for mature individuals (males: 21.7%, females: 24.2%) and in September for juveniles (19.8%). Sandeel condition responds quickly to changes in prey availability and can be used as an indicator sensitive to of productivity and environmental change on the banks in West Greenland. In the light of rapid climate changes in Arctic marine ecosystems, the present findings may serve as a baseline for future monitoring of the productivity of pelagic ecosystems in West Greenland.

Moreover, they are the basis of the most important fisheries resources; for example, in African waters. In this study, we have sampled pelagic fish larvae in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean along a latitudinal gradient between 37 degrees N and 2 degrees S. We have employed Bongo nets for plankton sampling and sorted visually fish and fish larvae. Using the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) as a DNA barcode, we have identified 44 OTUs down to species level that correspond to 14 families, with Myctophidae being the most abundant. A few species were cosmopolitan and others latitude-specific, as was expected. The latitudinal pattern of diversity did not exhibit a temperate-tropical cline; instead, it was likely correlated with environmental conditions with a decline in low-oxygen zones. Importantly, gaps and inconsistencies in reference DNA databases impeded accurate identification to the species level of 49% of the individuals. Fish sampled from tropical latitudes and some orders, such as Perciformes, Myctophiformes and Stomiiformes, were largely unidentified due to incomplete references. Some larvae were identified based on morphology and COI analysis for comparing time and costs employed from each methodology. These results suggest the need of reinforcing DNA barcoding reference datasets of Atlantic bathypelagic tropical fish that, as main prey of top predators, are crucial for ecosystem-based management of fisheries resources.

This applies particularly to seabirds, which, as top marine predators, are often considered as indicators of marine ecosystem changes. Most studies have so far been conducted in polar or temperate regions. However, important changes in the functioning of tropical marine ecosystems have been reported, but the responses of top predators remain poorly known. This study focused on a tropical seabird, Audubon's shearwater Puffinus lherminieri, analyzing the relationships between climate change and the survival of adults, nesting success, and population dynamics. The population studied breeds in Martinique, in the south of the Caribbean region, which is strongly influenced by the Amazon and Orinoco rivers. A data set for the period 1995 to 2014 was used to estimate the survival by age classes and breeding success and to determine which climate variables most affected demographic parameters. The population dynamics were modeled to predict the future population growth rates in response to climate change. The annual adult survival rate increased over the last 20 years, currently standing at 94% for adult birds more than 6 years old. Adult survival increased with sea surface temperature (SST) during the nonbreeding season as well as with Amazon River discharge, although the latter with a lag of 1 year. The effect of SST was explained by the positive relationship between SST and chlorophyll a during years of high discharge from the Amazon and Orinoco. The population decreased between 1995 and 2007 at a rate of 3% per year and then increased between 2008 and 2014 at a rate of 7% per year. The increase in adult survival observed should continue as temperatures increase in the future, and the population models predicted a stable or increasing population over the next 50 years (lambda = 1.018). These results contrast with the negative effect of increasing SST on seabird populations found in temperate and polar regions, emphasizing the need to study the impact of climate change on tropical seabirds.

Temporal and spatial variation of beaked and sperm whales foraging activity in Hawai'i, as determined with passive acoustics	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							CUVIERS ZIPHIUS-CAVIROSTRIS; ODONTOCETE CETACEANS; CYCLONIC EDDIES; OCEAN; MOVEMENTS; RECORDERS; ABUNDANCE; SEAMOUNT; ATLANTIC; BEHAVIOR	Beaked and sperm whales are top predators living in the waters off the Kona coast of Hawai'i. Temporal and spatial analyses of the foraging activity of these two species were studied with passive acoustics techniques. Three passive acoustics recorders moored to the ocean floor were used to monitor the foraging activity of these whales in three locations along the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii. Data were analyzed using automatic detector/classification systems: M3R (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges), and custom-designed MATLAB programs. The temporal variation in foraging activity was species-specific: beaked whales foraged more at night in the north, and more during the day-time off Kailua-Kona. No day-time/night-time preference was found in the southern end of the sampling range. Sperm whales foraged mainly at night in the north, but no day-time/night-time preference was observed off Kailua-Kona and in the south. A Generalized Linear Model was then applied to assess whether location and chlorophyll concentration affected the foraging activity of each species. Chlorophyll concentration and location influenced the foraging activity of both these species of deep-diving odontocetes. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

To explore the baseline levels and the main characteristics of the components, the concentrations of vanadium (V), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) were determined in the melon of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that this method was quite suitable for the determination of trace elements in the melon of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins with highly accuracy and precision, and the trace elements in melon existed individual differences. The average contents were in the order of Zn>As>Cu.>Ma>Se>Hg>Cr>Ni>V>Pb>Cd. It is worth noting that the within (1. 158 mu g . g(-1) ww), non-essential toxic trace element may cause toxic effect on the dolphins. Spearman correlation analysis showed positively significant correlations between As, Cd, Hg and body length, indicating that the concentrations of As, Cd, Hg may increase with age. Moreover, Cr and Ni were positively correlated (p<0. 05), a significant negative correlation was observed between Mn and As (p<0. 01), indicating that there are certain correlation among elements. In addition, the principal component analysis results showed that V, Mn, Ni, Se, Cu, Hg are the main characteristics of trace elements for melon. This study presents a reliable method for determination of the trace element analysis in cetacean melon, and this is the first study that reports the trance elements in the melon of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in PRE that could provide reasonable and effective information for its conservation work.

However, the mechanistic basis for facultative scavenging remains poorly understood. The co-occurrence of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) at Raine Island (Australia), provides an opportunity to examine a top marine predator's feeding mode in response to seasonal pulses in nesting turtles that offer both hunting and scavenging opportunities. Using satellite telemetry, we evaluated home range overlap between sharks and turtles and quantified their surfacing behavior around Raine Island during the turtle nesting season. We found core home range overlap to be highest during the nesting season. Both sharks and turtles spent significantly more time at the surface in areas of greatest range overlap closest to shore, where turtle density was highest. Both sharks and turtles showed decreased surfacing with increasing distance from Raine Island. Combined with published data on turtle demography at Raine Island, we propose the following: (1) sharks patrol the surface to increase scavenging opportunities on turtle carcasses and intercept weakened individuals after nesting; (2) healthy turtles may not perceive sharks as a major threat and/or other biological factors override anti-predatory responses; and (3) sharks during the nesting season may primarily scavenge on dead turtles individuals rather than actively hunt. Our study results and approach may be applicable to other situations in which direct observations of predator-prey interactions are limited. Every animal encounters dead or dying resources, yet the role of facultative scavenging has been difficult to study, and thus largely overlooked in marine behavioral ecological research. Movement analyses of tiger shark and green turtle movement and surfacing behavior at Raine Island (Australia) suggest that facultative scavenging may be a prevalent, yet underappreciated, feeding strategy in tiger sharks. Our integration of behavioral ecology theory with multi-species electronic tagging provided a valuable approach for investigating predator-prey interactions in situations where direct observations are limited or not possible.

However, due to high costs of the analyses, only one investigation comprised the determination of dioxins and related compounds (DRCs) in Guiana dolphin tissues. The dioxin responsive-chemically activated luciferase gene expression (DR-CALUX(A (R))) cell bioassay was used in the present study for the analyses of hepatic samples from 28 male Guiana dolphins in order to screen estuarine environments for DRCs, comprising three regions (Northeastern, Southeastern, and Southern) and four states [Parana (PR), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Espirito Santo (ES), and Ceara (CE)] of Brazil. High bioanalytical equivalent (BEQ) concentrations [dioxins (pg BEQ/g lipid)] were found, varying from 1.94 to 15.6 pg BEQ/g. A significant negative correlation between BEQ concentrations and total length was found in Guiana dolphins from Brazil (all analysed dolphins). This pattern also was verified for RJ state, pointing to (1) chemically induced developmental disruption or to (2) increasing efficiency of the detoxifying activity with the growth of the animal. Comparison was performed with literature data and significantly higher BEQ levels were found in Brazilian Guiana dolphins than in those reported for North Sea harbour porpoises. Higher levels were found in Southeastern (the most PBT-contaminated area of the country) than in Southern region. However, it is not possible to affirm that Guiana dolphins are more contaminated by DRCs in SE than in S region, because individuals were lengthier in S than in SE region. Our results seem to have mirrored dolphin exposure to PCBs in Brazil according to the literature. Further studies are required for investigating the hypotheses 1 and 2 mentioned above.

Molecular identification and functional characteristics of peptide transporters in the bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo)	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Elasmobranch; Bonnethead shark; PepT1; PepT2; Scroll valve intestine; Absorption	GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; TRIAKIS-SEMIFASCIATA; DAILY RATION; TELEOST; DIGESTION; LEWINI; DIET	Elasmobranchs are considered to be top marine predators, and in general play important roles in the transfer of energy within marine ecosystems. Despite this, little is known regarding the physiological processes of digestion and nutrient absorption in these fishes. One topic that is particularly understudied is the process of nutrient uptake across the elasmobranch gastrointestinal tract. Given their carnivorous diet, the present study sought to expand knowledge on dietary nutrient uptake in elasmobranchs by focusing on the uptake of products of protein digestion. To accomplish this, a full-length cDNA encoding peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), a protein previously identified within the brush border membrane of vertebrates that is responsible for the translocation of peptides released during digestion by luminal and membrane-bound proteases, was isolated from the bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo). A cDNA encoding the related peptide transporter PepT2 was also isolated from S. tiburo using the same methodology. The presence of PepT1 was then localized in multiple components of the bonnethead digestive tract (esophagus, stomach, duodenum, intestine, rectum, and pancreas) using immunohistochemistry. Vesicle studies were used to identify the apparent affinity of PepT1 and to quantify the rate of dipeptide uptake by its H+-dependent cotransporter properties. The results of this study provide insight into the properties of peptide uptake within the bonnethead gut, and can facilitate future work on physiological regulation of protein metabolism and absorption including how these processes may vary in elasmobranchs that exhibit different feeding strategies.

Risk assessment and predator learning in a changing world: understanding the impacts of coral reef degradation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MINNOWS PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; FATHEAD MINNOWS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSES; MARINE COMMUNITIES; FISH; REPLENISHMENT; BIODIVERSITY; RECOGNITION	Habitat degradation is among the top drivers of the loss of global biodiversity. This problem is particularly acute in coral reef system. Here we investigated whether coral degradation influences predator risk assessment and learning for damselfish. When in a live coral environment, Ambon damselfish were able to learn the identity of an unknown predator upon exposure to damselfish alarm cues combined with predator odour and were able to socially transmit this learned recognition to naive conspecifics. However, in the presence of dead coral water, damselfish failed to learn to recognize the predator through alarm cue conditioning and hence could not transmit the information socially. Unlike alarm cues of Ambon damselfish that appear to be rendered unusable in degraded coral habitats, alarm cues of Nagasaki damselfish remain viable in this same environment. Nagasaki damselfish were able to learn predators through conditioning with alarm cues in degraded habitats and subsequently transmit the information socially to Ambon damselfish. Predator-prey dynamics may be profoundly affected as habitat degradation proceeds; the success of one species that appears to have compromised predation assessment and learning, may find itself reliant on other species that are seemingly unaffected by the same degree of habitat degradation.

In Chesapeake Bay, USA, warming is likely to favor the more heat and stress-tolerant Ruppia maritima (widgeongrass) over Zostera marina (eelgrass). Because of the key role of seagrasses in providing habitat and trophic support, it is important to determine whether the more stress-tolerant seagrass provides similar ecological functions to the species it may replace. We addressed how trophic control differs between communities associated with the 2 seagrass species in a mesocosm experiment. Grazing of epiphytic algae can benefit seagrasses over competing algae, and crustacean mesograzers are an important link for higher trophic levels. We manipulated seagrass density, species identity, and presence of grazers and predators, and examined the resulting communities of recruiting algae and invertebrates. Overall, predation was higher in Ruppia than in Zostera, although mesograzer species individually differed in their susceptibility to predation and response to seagrass species. The presence of grazers and predators had a greater overall effect on multivariate metrics of fouling community development than did seagrass species identity. Initial densities of seagrass and grazer species had interactive effects on some recruiting microalgae and tunicates. Differences in grazer composition and predation between seagrass species could have consequences for higher trophic levels that rely on fauna in seagrass beds. However, given the considerable effects of manipulated seagrass and mesograzer density on trophic interactions and the fouling community, it may be most important to consider the overall density and distribution of seagrass present, rather than seagrass species identity.

Predator species can influence host-parasite interactions, either by preferentially feeding on infected (or uninfected) hosts-and thus altering parasite prevalence patterns-or by affecting host behavior in ways that increase host susceptibility to parasites. In this study, we tested if predators (the mud crab Panopeus herbstii and the blue crab Callinectes sapidus) influence interactions between the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica and 2 of its most prevalent parasites, Perkinsus marinus and Haplosporidium nelsoni. Using a combination of field and laboratory experiments, we tested for predatory effects on the prevalence and intensity of parasite infections and on oyster immune response (phagocytic activity). Our results consistently demonstrated that crabs do not influence parasite infections in oysters at either individual or population levels. Thus, even though predators often have strong top-down direct and indirect effects on marine communities, we found their influence on host-parasite interactions to be minimal in this system.

Aquatic ecosystems are degraded by a variety of pressures as a result of the growing human population. Global-scale impacts include homogenization of biological communities, removal of top predators and ecosystem engineers, chemical pollution by excess nutrients and contaminants as well as deteriorating structural diversity, connectivity and process dynamics. There is a pressing societal need to reverse the decline in biodiversity and replace lost ecosystem functioning and services in aquatic ecosystems by enabling natural recovery or by active restoration. 2. Common concepts and approaches for conservation, recovery and restoration in freshwater and marine ecosystems, aided by recent advances in ecological theory, include decision criteria on priorities for conservation, harnessing natural recovery by cessation of impacts, restoring connectivity and meso-habitat diversity as well as the geomorphological structural template including hydrodynamic processes. Re-oligotrophication at catchment or regional sea-scale benefits from integrating freshwater and marine restoration. Species or assemblages that convey biogenic structure or act as ecosystem engineers and keystone species should be given priority. Top-down control can be reinstated in closed systems. 3. Differences between freshwater and marine ecosystems include the greater spatial restriction of many species in fresh water, the importance of rooted vegetation and insects in freshwater, and the much greater dispersal and connectivity in marine systems. These differences dictate different approaches, with more scope for active restoration work in fresh water and harnessing natural recovery in marine systems. 4. Restoration schemes need clearly defined target states. They should generally take a process-oriented and stepwise adaptive management approach judging success against reference or control sites. Societal and political expectations need to be managed and restoration schemes should not promise too much. Even minor rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems can put back some biodiversity and key services. Sometimes 'Ersatz'-ecosystems are better than nothing and the best that can be achieved, especially in urban settings. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We combined GPS data loggers, miniaturised cameras, dietary sampling and nutritional geometry to examine the nutritional variability in the prey and selected diet, and foraging performance, of the masked booby (Sula dactylatra tasmani), a wild carnivore and marine top predator. Data loggers also revealed no significant differences between sexes in the foraging performance of chick-rearing adults. Females provided more food to their chicks than the males and, regardless of the nutritional variability of prey consumed, both sexes showed similar amounts of protein and lipid in their diets. Miniaturised cameras combined with nutritional analysis of prey provided, for the first time, fine-scale detail of the amounts of macronutrients consumed in each plunge dive and the overall foraging trip. Our methodology could be considered for future studies that aim to contribute to the general understanding of the behavioural and physiological mechanisms and ecological and evolutionary significance of animal foraging (e.g. energy expenditure budgets and prey selection for self- and offspring-feeding that could lead to sex-specific foraging strategies).

Certain shark species, often feeding at, or near the top of the food-chain have the ability to bioaccumulate a suite of toxins, from both anthropogenic and algal sources. As such, these apex predators are likely sinks for CTXs. This assumption, in conjunction with anecdotal knowledge of poisoning incidents, several nonspecific feeding trials whereby various terrestrial animals were fed suspect fish flesh, and a single incident in Madagascar in 1994, have resulted in the widespread acceptance that sharks may accumulate CTXs. This prompted a study to investigate original claims within the literature, as well as investigate CTX bioaccumulation in the muscle and liver of 22 individual sharks from nine species, across four locations along the east coast of Australia. Utilizing an updated ciguatoxin extraction method with HPLC-MS/MS, we were unable to detect P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 or P-CTX-3, the three primary CTX congeners, in muscle or liver samples. We propose four theories to address this finding: (1) to date, methods have been optimized for teleost species and may not be appropriate for elasmobranchs, or the CI-Xs may be below the limit of detection; (2) CTX may be biotransformed into elasmobranch-specific congeners as a result of unique metabolic properties; (3) 22 individuals may be an inadequate sample size given the rare occurrence of high-order ciguatoxic organisms and potential for CTX depuration; and (4) the ephemeral nature and inconsistent toxin profiles of Gambierdiscus blooms may have undermined our classifications of certain areas as CTX hotspots. These results, in combination with the lack of clarity within the literature, suggest that ciguatoxin bioaccumulation in sharks remains elusive, and warrants further investigation to determine the dynamics of toxin production, accumulation and transformation throughout the entire food-web.

ABUNDANCE; ROCKFISH SEBASTES; ENGRAULIS-MORDAX; PHALACROCORAX-PENICILLATUS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; TROPHIC LEVEL; ENGLISH SOLE; SEABIRD; CLIMATE; PREY	Effective ecosystem-based management requires a comprehensive understanding of the functional links in the system. In many marine systems, forage species constitute a critical link between primary production and upper trophic level marine predators. As top predators, seabirds can be indicators of the forage species they consume and the ocean processes that influence these populations. We analyzed the diet and breeding success for the years 1994, 2003, 2005, and 2007-2012 of the Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus), a piscivorous diving seabird, breeding in central California, to evaluate the extent to which cormorant diet composition relates to prey availability, and how diet composition relates to breeding success and ocean conditions. Cormorant diet was primarily composed of young-of-the-year (YOY) northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), YOY rockfish (Sebastes spp.), and several species of small flatfish (order Pleuronectiformes). YOY rockfish consumption was positively related to their abundance as measured in a late spring pelagic midwater trawl survey. Northern anchovy appeared to be the most important prey as its consumption was positively related to cormorant breeding success. More northern anchovy were consumed in years where warm-water conditions prevailed in the fall season before cormorant breeding. Thus, warm ocean conditions in the fall appear to be an important contributing factor in producing a strong year-class of northern anchovy in central California and consequently a strong-year class of Brandt's cormorant on the Farallon Islands.

Remote, near-pristine areas provide some baseline expectations for biomass [2, 3] and suggest that predators dominate, producing an inverted biomass pyramid. The southern pass of Fakarava atoll a biosphere reserve in French Polynesia hosts an average of 600 reef sharks, two to three times the biomass per hectare documented for any other reef shark aggregations [4]. This huge biomass of predators makes the trophic pyramid inverted. Bioenergetics models indicate that the sharks require similar to 90 tons of fish per year, whereas the total fish production in the pass is similar to 17 tons per year. Energetic theory shows that such trophic structure is maintained through subsidies [5-9], and empirical evidence suggests that sharks must engage in wide-ranging foraging excursions to meet energy needs [9, 10]. We used underwater surveys and acoustic telemetry to assess shark residency in the pass and feeding behavior and used bioenergetics models to understand energy flow. Contrary to previous findings, our results highlight that sharks may overcome low local energy availability by feeding on fish spawning aggregations, which concentrate energy from other local trophic pyramids. Fish spawning aggregations are known to be targeted by sharks, but they were previously believed to play a minor role representing occasional opportunistic supplements. This research demonstrates that fish spawning aggregations can play a significant role in the maintenance of local inverted pyramids in pristine marine areas. Conservation of fish spawning aggregations can help conserve shark populations, especially if combined with shark fishing bans.

In the Foxe Basin region of Nunavut, Canada, the size of the polar bear subpopulation has remained largely stable over the past 20 years, despite concurrent declines in sea ice habitat. We used fatty acid analysis to examine polar bear feeding habits in Foxe Basin and thus potentially identify ecological factors contributing to population stability. Adipose tissue samples were collected from 103 polar bears harvested during 2010-2012. Polar bear diet composition varied spatially within the region with ringed seal (Pusa hispida) comprising the primary prey in northern and southern Foxe Basin, whereas polar bears in Hudson Strait consumed equal proportions of ringed seal and harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus). Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) consumption was highest in northern Foxe Basin, a trend driven by the ability of adult male bears to capture large-bodied prey. Importantly, bow-head whale (Balaena mysticetus) contributed to polar bear diets in all areas and all age and sex classes. Bowhead carcasses resulting from killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation and subsistence harvest potentially provide an important supplementary food source for polar bears during the ice-free period. Our results suggest that the increasing abundance of killer whales and bowhead whales in the region could be indirectly contributing to improved polar bear foraging success despite declining sea ice habitat. However, this indirect interaction between top predators may be temporary if continued sea ice declines eventually severely limit on-ice feeding opportunities for polar bears.

Additionally, the correlation between differences in individual boldness and stress reactivity was examined, exploring indications of individual coping styles. Heterodontus portusjacksoni demonstrated highly repeatable individual differences in boldness and stress reactivity. Individual boldness scores were highly repeatable across four trials such that individuals that were the fastest to emerge in the first trial were also the fastest to emerge in subsequent trials. Additionally, individuals that were the most reactive to a handling stressor in the first trial were also the most reactive in a second trial. The strong link between boldness and stress response commonly found in teleosts was also evident in this study, providing evidence of proactive-reactive coping styles in H. portusjacksoni. These results demonstrate the presence of individual personality differences in sharks for the first time. Understanding how personality influences variation in elasmobranch behaviour such as prey choice, habitat use and activity levels is critical to better managing these top predators which play important ecological roles in marine ecosystems.

Sex-specific and individual preferences for hunting strategies in white sharks	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						acoustic telemetry; foraging mode; fine-scale movement; hidden Markov Model; predator-prey	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ARCTOCEPHALUS-PUSILLUS-PUSILLUS; SOUTH-FARALLON-ISLANDS; CAPE FUR SEALS; CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; FORAGING MODE; MARINE PREDATOR; ACTIVE-SEARCH; HABITAT USE	Fine-scale predator movements may be driven by many factors including sex, habitat and distribution of resources. There may also be individual preferences for certain movement strategies within a population which can be hard to quantify. Within top predators, movements are also going to be directly related to the mode of hunting, for example sit-and-wait or actively searching for prey. Although there is mounting evidence that different hunting modes can cause opposing trophic cascades, there has been little focus on the modes used by top predators, especially those in the marine environment. Adult white sharks (Carcharhodon carcharias) are well known to forage on marine mammal prey, particularly pinnipeds. Sharks primarily ambush pinnipeds on the surface, but there has been less focus on the strategies they use to encounter prey. We applied mixed hidden Markov models to acoustic tracking data of white sharks in a coastal aggregation area in order to quantify changing movement states (area-restricted searching (ARS) vs. patrolling) and the factors that influenced them. Individuals were re-tracked over multiple days throughout a month to see whether state-switching dynamics varied or if individuals preferred certain movement strategies. Sharks were more likely to use ARS movements in the morning and during periods of chumming by ecotourism operators. Furthermore, the proportion of time individuals spent in the two different states and the state-switching frequency, differed between the sexes and between individuals. Predation attempts/success on pinnipeds were observed for sharks in both ARS and patrolling movement states and within all random effects groupings. Therefore, white sharks can use both a sit-and-wait' (ARS) and active searching' (patrolling) movements to ambush pinniped prey on the surface. White sharks demonstrate individual preferences for fine-scale movement patterns, which may be related to their use of different hunting modes. Marine top predators are generally assumed to use only one type of hunting mode, but we show that there may be a mix within populations. As such, individual variability should be considered when modelling behavioural effects of predators on prey species.

These habitats are subject to anthropogenic pressures, of which eutrophication is one major stressor. Eutrophication favours fast-growing ephemeral algae over perennial macroalgae and seagrasses, causing habitat degradation. However, changes in top-down control, caused by, for example, overfishing, may also have negative impacts on such habitats by decreasing grazer control of ephemeral algae. Meanwhile, systematic analyses estimating top-down effects of predator manipulations across a wide range of studies are missing, limiting the potential use of top-down control measures in coastal management. Here, we review the literature on experiments that test top-down and bottom-up controls in seagrass Zostera marina and seaweed Fucus spp. food webs in the North Atlantic. Using meta-analysis and meta-regression, we compare effect sizes of consumer and nutrient manipulations on primary producers, grazers and mesopredators. Presence of mesopredators on average doubled the biomass of ephemeral algae through trophic cascades, mainly mediated via negative effects on amphipods and isopods. Of the grazers, gastropods had twice as strong a negative effect on ephemeral algae as amphipods/isopods, but responded weakly to both predators and fertilization. In accordance with theory, top-down effects became stronger with eutrophication. Across studies, top-down effects on ephemeral algae at all trophic levels are on par with eutrophication effects. However, the few studies manipulating piscivorous fish make estimates of their top-down effects uncertain.Synthesis and applications. Consistently strong top-down effects in coastal ecosystems call for an integrated ecosystem perspective. Management should consider measures to improve stocks of predatory fish and reduce mesopredators for restoration and conservation of essential seagrass and seaweed habitats, thereby increasing the long-term viability of ecosystem services from coastal habitats.

This applies to the Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus, the most endangered European seabird, whose time to extinction was estimated at only 40years a decade ago. Since the previous assessment, new data and more sophisticated demographic modelling have become available, and new fishing policies from the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy, CFP) will apply, posing different scenarios for the viability of the species. Thus, there is both an urgent need and an opportunity for a more reliable update of the conservation status of the species. Demographic data were collected between 1985 and 2014 at one of the world's largest colonies. Most demographic parameters were estimated using multievent capture-recapture modelling. Some parameters, such as bycatch rate, immature individual survival and recruitment, were estimated for the first time. We incorporated estimates into stochastic population models to forecast time to extinction and assess the viability under different management scenarios, accounting for upcoming fishing policies. Adult survival was much lower than expected (0809, SE: 0013) and largely influenced by bycatch, which accounted for a minimum of 0455 (SE: 0230) of total mortality. Breeding success was positively correlated with discard availability. Recruitment started at low rates in 3-year-old birds (0030, SE: 00455), increasing in following age classes and was almost complete at 6years. Under the present scenario, we predict a time to extinction of 61years (95% CI: 55-69).Synthesis and applications. Population projections suggest that the actual impact of fisheries on Balearic shearwaters is unsustainable and the imminent discard ban under the new Common Fisheries Policy may accelerate the declining trend. This study demonstrates that reducing the bycatch rates of fisheries is an unavoidable and urgent conservation measure for avoiding the extinction of the species. We also advise setting up demographic long-term studies, to allow researchers to diagnose, with reliability, the effectiveness of management actions. These actions will also benefit many other marine top-predator species affected by this anthropogenic impact.

Areas of predictable prey yield are of conservation importance, and telemetry data aid in identifying such areas. This study examined colony-specific and intra-individual foraging site fidelity of lactating subantarctic fur seals Arctocephalus tropicalis from Marion Island, Southern Ocean (46 degrees 54' S, 37 degrees 45' E), during summer and winter, comparing commitment to foraging areas across seasons. Thirty females were tracked in 2009-2013, resulting in 109 foraging trips for analyses. Inter-annually, preferred foraging areas in summer were consistently similar to 200 km due east of Marion Island towards the Gallieni Rise. Summer individuals' core utilization areas overlapped by an estimated 32.84% (CI: 24.53-41.94%). Seals responded to a decrease in regional productivity in winter by foraging in more distant, alternative areas. In winter, individuals changed their travelling direction to northeast of Marion Island and foraged further afield, around the Del Cano Rise and along the Southwest Indian Ridge. Despite preferring some foraging areas in winter, there was a low amount of overlap 6.03% (CI 4.02-9.16%) of individual core utilization areas. The foraging grounds identified in this study have not been included in prior conservation assessments and are important for conserving this globally significant, and currently declining, population of subantarctic fur seals and perhaps other top predators breeding at Marion Island as well. Differences between foraging areas preferred in winter and summer highlight the importance of sampling during different seasons when using telemetry data for the identification of potential pelagic conservation areas.

Thereby, the risk of accidents increase. Immediate negative impacts are expected from oil spills through the acute mortality for marine organisms, especially from heavy fuel oil (HFO). Marine Diesel oil (MDO) is therefore suggested as a preferable fuel for ships operating in Arctic waters. However, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic components in both types of fuel, are highly bioavailable and can transfer up the food chain. A spill of MDO following a shipwreck could therefore have impacts beyond the spill site and long after the diesel has spread and evaporated. We model the spread of PAHs from a fictitious spill of MDO in the Pechora Sea (South Eastern Barents Sea) using the contaminant tracer module Ecotracer, in the Ecopath modelling software. We address the effects on the food-web including long term effects by combining toxicology and food web modelling. Ecotracer assumes that pollutants follow the biomass passively through the system, and degradation of pollutants is following user specified rates. By combining in natura measurements of PAHs in seawater and in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) recorded at an accidental MDO spill site, with experiments conducted on the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) and blue mussels, we derived values as inputs into the model. The Ecotracer predicted that the pollution in the mussels will spread throughout the food-web, especially to the top predators of mussels, king eider (Somateria spectabilis) and Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) and also from snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) to seals and toothed whales.

We review and expand current theory concerning these relationships. Location Data for evaluating this question come from several Bahamian archipelagos and involve both experiments and observations. The latter can be especially long term; in one case data were collected over a 17-year period. Methods We analyse the effect size of the following interactions across a range of island areas: (1) predation by lizards on spiders, (2) competition between two lizard species, (3) competition between two spider species, (4) ant-plant mutualism, and (5) plant-pollinator mutualism. Results Effect sizes for predation and competition mostly show a hump-shaped relationship with island area. Effect sizes for ant-plant mutualism were reduced on large islands compared with smaller islands. Germination rate showed a steady increase with island area which we infer to be caused by an increase in pollinator limitation on smaller islands. Main conclusions We argue that the effect size-area relation has rather similar aetiologies for predation, competition and to a somewhat lesser extent ant-plant mutualism. Specifically, we suggest that high species diversity, top predators, plant defences and (for predation and competition) spatial heterogeneity with respect to refuges or resource use reduce effect size on large islands, while harsh abiotic conditions, marine subsidies and stochastic events reduce effect size on small islands. Thus, for these interaction types, the greatest effect sizes are observed on intermediate-sized islands. For plant-pollinator mutualism we suggest that the monotonic increase in effect size with increasing island area is the result of interaction strength being enhanced, rather than weakened, by diversity.

Stable isotope ratio of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were also measured to infer the role of foraging habitat on the contamination. For another group from the same colony, GPS tracks were recorded to identify potential foraging areas where the birds may get contaminated. Fourteen trace elements were targeted as well as a total of 40 individual POPs, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The concentration of Hg in the blood was up to 6 times higher in adults (5.81 +/- 1.27 mu g g(-1) dw.) than in nestlings (0.99 +/- 0.23 mu g g(-1) dw.). A similar pattern was found for POPs. Sigma PCBs was the prevalent group both in adults (median 673, range 336 -2801 pg g(-1) ww.) and nestlings (median 41, range 19-232 pg g(-1) ww.), followed by the sum of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and metabolites (Sigma DDTs), showing a median value of 220 (range 75 -2342 pg g(-1) ww.) in adults and 25 (range 13-206 pg g(-1) ww.) in nestlings. The isotope data suggested that the accumulation of trace elements and POPs between adults and nestlings could be due to parental foraging in two different areas during incubation and chick rearing, respectively, or due to a shift in the feeding strategies along the breeding season. In conclusion, our work showed high Hg concentration in frigatebirds compared to non-contaminated seabird populations, while other trace elements showed lower values within the expected range in other seabird species. Finally, POP exposure was found generally lower than that previously measured in other seabird species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Top predators negate the effect of mesopredators on prey physiology	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						coral reef fish; metabolic rate; non-consumptive effects; predator-prey interactions; respirometry; trait-mediated indirect effects	MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; CORAL-REEF FISH; BASS MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES; TROPHIC CASCADES; METABOLIC-RATE; POMACENTRUS-AMBOINENSIS; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; 3-SPINED STICKLEBACKS; INSPECTION BEHAVIOR; FIELD EVIDENCE	Predation theory and empirical evidence suggest that top predators benefit the survival of resource prey through the suppression of mesopredators. However, whether such behavioural suppression can also affect the physiology of resource prey has yet to be examined. Using a three-tier reef fish food web and intermittent-flow respirometry, our study examined changes in the metabolic rate of resource prey exposed to combinations of mesopredator and top predator cues. Under experimental conditions, the mesopredator (dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus) continuously foraged and attacked resource prey (juveniles of the damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis) triggering an increase in prey O-2 uptake by 38129% (mean +/- SE). The visual stimulus of a top predator (coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus) restricted the foraging activity of the mesopredator, indirectly allowing resource prey to minimize stress and maintain routine O-2 uptake. Although not as strong as the effect of the top predator, the sight of a large non-predator species (thicklip wrasse, Hemigymnus melapterus) also reduced the impact of the mesopredator on prey metabolic rate. We conclude that lower trophic-level species can benefit physiologically from the presence of top predators through the behavioural suppression that top predators impose on mesopredators. By minimizing the energy spent on mesopredator avoidance and the associated stress response to mesopredator attacks, prey may be able to invest more energy in foraging and growth, highlighting the importance of the indirect, non-consumptive effects of top predators in marine food webs.

The results showed lower PCB and DDT concentrations than those previously reported in various tuna species worldwide. A predominance of DDTs over PCBs was revealed, reflecting continuing inputs of DDT. Tuna collected from SA exhibited higher contamination levels than those from RI, related to higher dietary inputs and higher total lipid content. Greater variability in contamination levels and profiles was identified in tuna from RI, explained by a higher diversity of prey and more individualistic foraging behaviour. PCB and DDT contamination levels and profiles varied significantly in tuna from the two investigated areas, probably reflecting exposure to different sources of contamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Intrinsic factors influence the timing of arrival of capelin (Mallotus villosus) to spawning grounds in coastal Newfoundland	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Capelin; Mallotus villosus; Timing of spawning; Intrinsic and extrinsic factors; Newfoundland	HERRING CLUPEA-HARENGUS; COD GADUS-MORHUA; STRONTIUM-CALCIUM RATIOS; OTOLITH CHEMISTRY; NORTHWEST ATLANTIC; WATER TEMPERATURE; FEEDING ECOLOGY; BARENTS SEA; BODY-SIZE; FISH	Capelin (Mallotus villosus) is an important forage fish species in many northern marine ecosystems and, thus, is the primary prey species of many top predators. On the Newfoundland shelf, capelin undergo extensive inshore migrations (>350 km) from offshore areas to coastal spawning grounds in the spring, where the timing of inshore arrival is highly variable. We investigated the influence of intrinsic factors (i.e., length, age, spawning experience) and proxies for extrinsic factors (i.e., environmental conditions via otolith chemistry; diet via stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios) on the individual-level timing of arrival of capelin at spawning sites on the northeast coast of Newfoundland during July 2012 and 2013. Despite high inter-annual and sex-based variation in almost all factors examined, intrinsic factors varied with timing of arrival at spawning sites, with larger, older male and female capelin arriving first at coastal spawning sites followed by smaller, younger capelin. Alternately, proxies of extrinsic factors did not vary with timing of arrival. Our findings suggest that selectively exploiting early-arriving fish may impact the age/size structure of the population, potentially leading to increased variability in the timing of spawning at the population level and possibly recruitment.

Samples were collected in the central Mediterranean Sea between 2010 and 2014. Plastics ingested belonged to small microplastics (0.2 - 2 mm), large microplastics (2 - 5 mm) and mesoplastics (5 - 25 mm), having mainly clear colors. Their frequency of occurrence in stomachs was equal to 2.7%, but it increases to 5.8% if only migratory species are considered. The higher number of plastics was found in E. risso and H. benoiti (5 in both species). The plastic ingestion may represent a risk for vertical migrant lanternfishes due to the increase in buoyancy. Ecotoxicological aspects linked to the potential effects of contaminants on lanternfish biology and to the transfer of pollutants throughout the marine trophic web up to top predators should be deepened.

Seasonal habitat-based density models for a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise, in a dynamic environment	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						aerial surveys; conservation; generalized additive model; harbor porpoise; marine mammals; marine spatial planning; North Sea; species distribution modeling; top predator	CUMULATIVE HUMAN IMPACTS; PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; NORTH-SEA; FORAGING STRATEGY; ABUNDANCE; SCALE; MANAGEMENT; AREAS; PREFERENCES; FRONTS	Effective species conservation and management requires information on species distribution patterns, which is challenging for highly mobile and cryptic species that may be subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors across international boundaries. Understanding species-habitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005-2013) by means of dedicated line-transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156,630 km of on-effort survey data with 14,356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for "season," allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-scale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea.

Here we show that fish functional diversity and biomass of top predators are significantly higher on coral reefs located at more than 20 h travel time from the main market compared with even the oldest (38 years old), largest (17,500 ha) and most restrictive (no entry) marine reserve in New Caledonia (South-Western Pacific). We further demonstrate that wilderness areas support unique ecological values with no equivalency as one gets closer to humans, even in large and well-managed marine reserves. Wilderness areas may therefore serve as benchmarks for management effectiveness and act as the last refuges for the most vulnerable functional roles.

Variability in the summer diets of juvenile polar cod (Boreogadus saida) in the northeastern Chukchi and western Beaufort Seas	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Polar cod; Stomach contents analysis; Western Arctic; Chukchi Sea; Beaufort Sea	ARCTIC COD; ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; DEMERSAL FISH; ATLANTIC COD; LEPECHIN 1773; GADUS-MORHUA; WATER MASS; ECOLOGY	Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is an important link between top predators and lower trophic levels in high-latitude marine ecosystems. Previous findings describe differences in its diet throughout the western Arctic; however, the causes of this variation are not well known. This study examined the diets of juvenile polar cod collected via demersal trawling methods over three summers in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (2010-2012) and one summer in the western Beaufort Sea (2011) to determine the amount of variability explained by biological, spatial, and interannual factors. Prey were identified, measured for length, and aggregated by percent mean weight into taxonomically coarse prey categories for analysis. Within seas, variation in juvenile polar cod diet composition was significantly related to body size, latitude, longitude, depth, and interannual (Chukchi Sea only) factors. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated body size was the most important factor contributing to the total variance in juvenile polar cod diet in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Body size-based diet differences between the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas were evaluated using non-metric multidimensional scaling. This method revealed that similar-sized polar cod consumed similar-sized prey in both seas, but their diets were more benthically influenced in the Chukchi Sea and more pelagically influenced in the Beaufort Sea. Juvenile polar cod diet compositions vary by body size and region of inhabitance throughout their distribution. Here, we show that body size was the primary factor explaining variation in the summer diet of juvenile polar cod within the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.

Ultrastructural and Single-Cell-Level Characterization Reveals Metabolic Versatility in a Microbial Eukaryote Community from an Ice-Covered Antarctic Lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; BACTERIOPLANKTON POPULATIONS; MARINE BACTERIOPLANKTON; PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOM; PTERIDOMONAS-DANICA; BETA-DIVERSITY; POLAR NIGHT; PROTISTS; BACTERIA	The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MCM) of southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, harbor numerous ice-covered bodies of water that provide year-round liquid water oases for isolated food webs dominated by the microbial loop. Single-cell microbial eukaryotes (protists) occupy major trophic positions within this truncated food web, ranging from primary producers (e.g., chlorophytes, haptophytes, and cryptophytes) to tertiary predators (e.g., ciliates, dinoflagellates, and choanoflagellates). To advance the understanding of MCM protist ecology and the roles of MCM protists in nutrient and energy cycling, we investigated potential metabolic strategies and microbial interactions of key MCM protists isolated from a well-described lake (Lake Bonney). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of enrichment cultures, combined with single amplified genome/amplicon sequencing and fluorescence microscopy, revealed that MCM protists possess diverse potential metabolic capabilities and interactions. Two metabolically distinct bacterial clades (Flavobacteria and Methylobacteriaceae) were independently associated with two key MCM lake microalgae (Isochrysis and Chlamydomonas, respectively). We also report on the discovery of two heterotrophic nanoflagellates belonging to the Stramenopila supergroup, one of which lives as a parasite of Chlamydomonas, a dominate primary producer in the shallow, nutrient-poor layers of the lake. IMPORTANCE Single-cell eukaryotes called protists play critical roles in the cycling of organic matter in aquatic environments. In the ice-covered lakes of Antarctica, protists play key roles in the aquatic food web, providing the majority of organic carbon to the rest of the food web (photosynthetic protists) and acting as the major consumers at the top of the food web (predatory protists). In this study, we utilized a combination of techniques (microscopy, cell sorting, and genomic analysis) to describe the trophic abilities of Antarctic lake protists and their potential interactions with other microbes. Our work reveals that Antarctic lake protists rely on metabolic versatility for their energy and nutrient requirements in this unique and isolated environment.

The toxins involved, ciguatoxins, are produced by certain dinoflagellates of the genus Gambierdiscus, and undergo biotransfer and biomagnification up the food web to planktivorous and ultimately, top predator fishes. In this paper, we reviewed the factors and processes that regulate the production of ciguatoxins, the ecological distribution and the pathways of their biotransfer, and fish consumption guidelines to prevent ciguatera-related food poisoning. Warm waters are commonly suggested as the most important factor that enhances toxic algal blooms and ciguatoxin production. Ecological distribution of ciguatoxic fish shows great regional specificity. In most endemic areas, carnivores such as groupers and other large fish have higher toxicity than their herbivorous and smaller counterparts, supporting the food chain hypothesis proposed by J.E. Randall (J.E. Randall, Bull. Mar. Sci. 8(3): 236-267, 1958); while in other areas, for example, French Polynesia, the opposite situations also exist, questioning the biomagnification hypothesis. Some countries and regions have taken measurements to prevent ciguatera poisoning through consumption guidelines. In this review, we look at some of the measures that could be used to prevent poisoning, while encouraging people to consume fish. For example, choosing smaller and lower trophic level fish are likely to be safer to consume. We suggest an approach to maintain better databases on ciguatera cases to instruct people on fish consumption safety, and develop a general guideline for fish consumption to reduce CFP.

We assembled 40 experts to identify key questions in this field, focussing on marine megafauna, which include a broad range of birds, mammals, reptiles, and fish. Research on these taxa has both underpinned many of the recent technical developments and led to fundamental discoveries in the field. We show that the questions have broad applicability to other taxa, including terrestrial animals, flying insects, and swimming invertebrates, and, as such, this exercise provides a useful roadmap for targeted deployments and data syntheses that should advance the field of movement ecology.

The Bayesian framework of isotopic niche through quantitative niche metrics was applied to estimate and compare the niche breadth of two sympatric coastal dolphins Pontoporia blainvillei and Sotalia guianensis in a tropical marine area. The standard ellipse areas (SEAs) based on species were quite similar, but the SEAs based on age class showed that the matures' niche space is larger than the immatures' for both dolphins. A probabilistic comparison of SEAs indicated that specific differences are negligible compared with age class differences. Trophic level measures (delta N-15 range) indicated that the dolphins are comparable as top predators, and that immature specimens have a lower range of trophic levels than mature ones. In terms of variability of food sources (delta C-13 range), S. guianensis showed a larger value than P. blainvillei and mature specimens had larger delta C-13 range than immatures for both species. In general, P. blainvillei and S. guianensis were similar in the niche metrics, with SEAs overlap of 52.1 and 39.7%. The immature specimens showed reduced isotopic niche overlap between species (<3%). In conclusion, Pontoporia blainvillei and S. guianensis specimens have similar isotopic niches, but pronounced differences between immature and mature specimens, both intraspecific and interspecific. Isotopic niche and quantitative metrics along with previous data on stomach contents provide a strong representation of species niche and their relationships.

In this study, we conducted visual surveys in the central Tyrrhenian Sea to determine areas with simultaneous presence of bottlenose dolphins, four species of seabirds (Audouin's gull, Yellow-legged gull, Yelkouan shearwater and Cory's shearwater), and baitballs occurring at the surface, indicating the presence of potential prey items. We also analysed their occurrence in relation to topography (depth, slope and distance from the shore) and seabed types. Kriging analysis identified areas with simultaneous presence of several marine top predators. Dolphin distribution appeared to be linked to gentle slope (6-10 m) and muddy seabed, possibly associated with prey distribution, whereas the four seabird species were more frequent in areas with a water depth of 100-150 m, gentle slope and muddy seabed, apart from Audouin's gull, which preferred a depth of 10-20 m. Baitball distribution was linked to depth (20-40 m), gentle slope (6-10 m) and muddy seabed. The overlapping presence of bottlenose dolphins, seabirds and baitballs allowed the identification of foraging areas, presumably representing biodiversity and productivity hotspots, located in waters of 50-100 m depth at the mouths of two rivers. This approach provides a promising tool for identifying highly productive coastal areas, and should also be recommended for wider-scale surveys.

Given their small body size (63 to 500 mu m) and high density, meiofauna are potential food items for predators such as deposit-feeding brachyuran crabs. Crab bioturbation may also affect meiofaunal assemblages through effects such as translocation to unsuitable microhabitats. This study aimed to investigate the significance and nature of top-down control on the density of meiofauna based on their interactions with deposit-feeding crabs in a mangrove and adjoining sandflat; specifically, whether the interaction is primarily physical or trophic. Field manipulative experiments were conducted within the aggregation zones of soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus) and fiddler crabs (Uca vomeris) in a mangrove-lined creek in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Meiofaunal density in five experimental cage treatments (Exclusion, Inclusion with complete crab ('Inclusion'), Inclusion with 'disabled' crab (feeding claw removed, 'Disabled'), Half-cage, and Ambient) was compared. Removal of soldier crabs from the cages (Exclusion) increased meiofaunal density (426 +/- 46 ind./10 cm(2); mean +/- SE) by 50% over that in the Inclusion treatment (283 +/- 22). The nature of the interactions was further investigated by comparing meiofaunal density in the Inclusion treatment (with both physical and trophic effects present) with that in the Disabled treatment (with physical but no trophic effect present). Removal of trophic effect by 'disabling the crab increased meiofaunal density by 30% compared to that in the Inclusion treatment, but at a similar density to the Exclusion treatment. This pattern suggests that the top-down control by soldier crabs on the meiofauna is fundamentally trophic, i.e. predation. In the experiment with fiddler crabs, meiofaunal densities in the inclusion treatments (Inclusion and Disabled) were not significantly different from each other, but density was reduced by more than 50% in the Exclusion treatment. Fiddler crabs significantly impact the meiofauna through their bioturbation activities such as sediment turnover and burrowing, but their trophic activities did not significantly reduce meiofaunal density. Different crab species at different habitats, therefore, may influence meiofaunal density through different processes on sub-tropical soft shores. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Postcranial anatomy of Pissarrachampsa sera (Crocodyliformes, Baurusuchidae) from the Late Cretaceous of Brazil: insights on lifestyle and phylogenetic significance	PEERJ			English	Article						Baurusuchidae; Osteoderms; Ecological habit; Adamantina formation; Mesoeucrocodylia; Notosuchia; Phylogenetic bias; Fossil; Paleontology; Bauru group	ALLIGATOR-MISSISSIPPIENSIS ARCHOSAURIA; EXTANT BIRDS NEORNITHES; BAURU BASIN; PROTOSUCHIAN ARCHOSAURIA; AXIAL SKELETON; UNSTABLE TAXA; SOFT-TISSUES; EVOLUTION; MESOEUCROCODYLIA; CHINA	The postcranial anatomy of Crocodyliforrnes has historically been neglected, as most descriptions are based solely on skulls. Yet, the significance of the postcraniurn in crocodyliforms evolution is reflected in the great lifestyle diversity exhibited by the group, with members ranging from terrestrial animals to semi-aquatic and fully marine forms. Recently, studies have emphasized the importance of the postcranium. Following this trend, here we present a detailed description of the postcranial elements of Pissarrachampsa sera (Mesoeucrocodylia, Baurusuchidae), from the Adamantina Formation (Bauru Group, Late Cretaceous of Brazil). The preserved elements include dorsal vertebrae, partial forehmb, pelvic girdle, and hindlimbs. Comparisons with the postcranial anatomy of baurusuchids and other crocodyliforms, together with body-size and mass estimates, lead to a better understanding of the paleobiology of Pissarracharnpsa sera, including its terrestrial lifestyle and its role as a top predator. Furthermore, the complete absence of osteoderms in P. sera, a condition previously known only in marine crocodyliforms, suggests osteoderrns very likely played a minor role in locomotion of baurusuchids, unlike other groups of terrestrial crocodyliforrns. Finally, a phylogenetic analysis including the newly recognized postcranial features was carried out, and exploratory analyses were performed to investigate the influence of both cranial and postcranial characters in the phylogeny of Crocodyliforrnes. Our results suggest that crocodyliform relationships are mainly determined by cranial characters. However, this seems to be a consequence of the great number of missing entries in the data set with only postcranial characters and not of the lack of potential (or synapomorphies) for this kind of data to reflect the evolutionary history of Crocodyliformes.

To reconstruct the presence/absence of predator-prey interactions, we assembled detailed quantitative information from the scientific literature on the stomach contents of 80 predator species (elasmobranchs, teleosts and invertebrates) collected in the Golfo de Tortugas (Colombia) between 1990 and 2009. We tested three conceptual models of network structure (random, small-world, and scale-free), characterized by different system properties and tolerance to perturbations, to evaluate which one better fitted the reconstructed food web. Our results suggest that this network has small-world structure and scale-free properties. An impact on one species may therefore spread to many species through short interaction chains; only a few nodes with high centrality values would support the network structure. However, contrary to current theory, our analysis revealed no clear relationships between species with high centrality and the large-scale structural patterns observed in the network (small-world and scale-free properties). This observation indicates that ecosystem-based fisheries management should prioritize not only high centrality species (e.g., shrimps, which furthermore are species of high commercial value in the area), but should also consider species with unique structural properties such as those with little or no topological redundancy such as large sharks. For this reason, top predator conservation needs more attention than currently received in fisheries management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, results from the most recent diet studies were used to expand the representation of the lesser-known non-target fish species (e.g. lancetfish, opah, snake mackerel) and 9 mid-trophic micronekton functional groups. The model framework Ecopath with Ecosim was used to construct an ecosystem energy budget and to examine how changes in the various micronekton groups impact apex predator biomass. Model results indicate that while micronekton fishes represented approximately 54% of micronekton biomass, they accounted for only 28% of the micronekton production. By contrast, crustaceans represented 24% of the biomass and accounted for 44% of production. Simulated ecosystem changes resulting from changes to micronekton groups demonstrated that crustaceans and mollusks are the most important direct trophic pathways to the top of the food web. Other groups appear to comprise relatively inefficient pathways or 'trophic dead-ends' that are loosely coupled to the top of the food web (e.g. gelatinous animals), such that biomass declines in these functional groups resulted in increased biomass at the highest trophic levels by increasing energy flow through more efficient pathways. Overall, simulated declines in the micronekton groups resulted in small changes in biomass at the very top of the food web, suggesting that this ecosystem is relatively ecologically resilient with diverse food web pathways. However, further understanding of how sensitive micronekton are to changes in ocean chemistry and temperature resulting from climate change is needed to fully evaluate and predict potential ecosystem changes.

Foraging Behavior of Subantarctic Fur Seals Supports Efficiency of a Marine Reserve's Design	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOUTHERN INDIAN-OCEAN; PRINCE-EDWARD-ISLANDS; ARCTOCEPHALUS-TROPICALIS; ELEPHANT SEALS; NORTH PACIFIC; OCEANOGRAPHIC FEATURES; SURFACE TEMPERATURES; HABITAT SELECTION; AMSTERDAM ISLAND; FRONTS SOUTH	Foraging behaviour of marine top predators is increasingly being used to identify areas of ecological importance. This is largely enabled by the ability of many such species to forage extensively in search of prey that is often concentrated in oceanographically productive areas. To identify important habitat in the Southern Indian Ocean within and around South Africa's Prince Edward Islands' Marine Protected Area (MPA), satellite transmitters were deployed on 12 lactating Subantarctic fur seals Arctocephalus tropicalis at Prince Edward Island (PEI) itself. Switching state space models were employed to correct ARGOS tracks and estimate behavioural states for locations along predicted tracks, namely travelling or area restricted search (ARS). A random forest model showed that distance from the study colony, longitude and distance from the Subantarctic Front were the most important predictors of suitable foraging habitat (inferred from ARS). Model-predicted suitable habitat occurred within the MPA in relatively close access to the colony during summer and autumn, but shifted northwards concurrently with frontal movements in winter and spring. The association of ARS with the MPA during summer-autumn was highly significant, highlighting the effectiveness of the recently declared reserve's design for capturing suitable foraging habitat for this and probably other marine top predator species.

In a context of global warming, this spatial shift could impact local trophic interactions: direct impacts may affect forage fish through modified predator-prey interactions, and indirect impactsmay materialize through competition with other resident predators. For instance, North Sea saithe (Pollachius virens) spatial overlap with hake has increased while saithe spawning-stock biomass has decreased recently notwithstanding a sustainable exploitation. In this context, we investigated the range of potential impacts resulting from most recent hake emergence in the North Sea, with a particular focus on saithe. We carried out a multispecies assessment of North Sea saithe, using the Stochastic MultiSpecies (SMS) model. In addition to top-down processes already implemented in SMS, we built in the model bottom-up processes, relating Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii) abundance and saithe weight-at-age. We simulated the effects, on all North Sea species being considered but focusing on Norway pout and saithe, of combining different hake abundance trends scenarios with the inclusion of bottom-up processes in SMS. North Sea saithe F-MSY was then evaluated in a multispecies context and contrasted with single-species value. The different scenarios tested revealed a negative impact of hake emergence on saithe biomass, resulting from an increase of predation pressure on Norway pout. These results confirm the competition assumption between saithe and hake in the North Sea and might partially explain the most recent decrease of saithe biomass. This study also highlighted that taking into account bottom-up processes in the stock assessment had a limited effect on the estimation of saithe FMSY which was consistent with single-species value.

We used Pollock's robust design capture recapture modelling to assess the influence of oceanographic variables, artisanal fisheries and human disturbance on several demographic parameters (abundance, temporary emigration and survival) of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), using long-term data on marked individuals from East Africa. Photo identification data was collected over 551 boat-based surveys between 2006 and 2009, with 137 individuals identified. Our best fitting model indicated that exposure to tourism (represented by the number of tourist boats) increased the probability of dolphins seasonally emigrating from the study area. The return rate of temporary emigrants was negatively linked to the seasonal sea surface temperature, probably associated with food availability. That model supported the existence of heterogeneity in annual local survival estimates, with transient dolphins showing a lower value than resident individuals (0.78 and 0.98, respectively). Furthermore, abundance estimates showed a small population size ranging from 19 individuals (95% CI: 11-33) to a maximum of 104 dolphins (95% CI: 78-139). This small population, together with their high site fidelity and coastal distribution, might be particularly vulnerable to human disturbances. This study highlights the influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on dolphin demography and population dynamics and the need to integrate these drivers to provide robust evidences for conservation stakeholders in an adaptive management framework.

Acoustic insights into the zooplankton dynamics of the eastern Weddell Sea	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Review							DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION; DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILER; KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; ANTARCTIC POLAR FRONT; MID-ATLANTIC BIGHT; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; MAUD-RISE; SEASONAL-VARIATION; SCOTIA SEA; OVERWINTERING STRATEGIES	The success of any efforts to determine the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems depends on understanding in the first instance the natural variations, which contemporarily occur on the interannual and shorter time scales. Here we present results on the environmental controls of zooplankton distribution patterns and behaviour in the eastern Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean. Zooplankton abundance and vertical migration are derived from the mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) and the vertical velocity measured by moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), which were deployed simultaneously at 64 degrees S, 66.5 degrees S and 69 degrees S along the Greenwich Meridian from February, 2005, until March, 2008. While these time series span a period of full three years they resolve hourly changes. A highly persistent behavioural pattern found at all three mooring locations is the synchronous diel vertical migration (DVM) of two distinct groups of zooplankton that migrate between a deep residence depth during daytime and a shallow depth during nighttime. The DVM was closely coupled to the astronomical daylight cycles. However, while the DVM was symmetric around local noon, the annual modulation of the DVM was clearly asymmetric around winter solstice or summer solstice, respectively, at all three mooring sites. DVM at our observation sites persisted throughout winter, even at the highest latitude exposed to the polar night. Since the magnitude as well as the relative rate of change of illumination is minimal at this time, we propose that the ultimate causes of DVM separated from the light mediated proximal cue that coordinates it. In all three years, a marked change in the migration behaviour occurred in late spring (late October/early November), when DVM ceased. The complete suspension of DVM after early November is possibly caused by the combination of two factors: (1) increased availability of food in the surface mixed layer provided by the phytoplankton spring bloom, and (2) vanishing diurnal enhancement of the threat from visually oriented predators when the illumination is quasi-continuous during the polar and subpolar summer. Zooplankton abundance in the water column, estimated as the mean MVBS in the depth range 50-300 m, was highest end of summer and lowest mid to end winter on the average annual cycle. However, zooplankton abundance varied several-fold between years and between locations. Based on satellite and in situ data of chlorophyll and sea ice as well as on hydrographic measurements, the inter annual and spatial variations of zooplankton mean abundance can be explained by differences in the magnitude of the phytoplankton spring bloom, which develops during the seasonal sea ice retreat. Whereas the vernal ice melt appears necessary to stimulate the blooming of phytoplankton, it is not the determinator of the blooms magnitude, its areal extent and duration. A possible explanation for the limitation of the phytoplankton bloom in some years is top-down control. We hypothesise that the phytoplankton spring development can be curbed by grazing when the zooplankton had attained high abundance by growth during the preceding summer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Vertical fatty acid composition in the blubber of leopard seals and the implications for dietary analysis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Antarctic Pack Ice Seals; Feeding; Lipids; Pinnipeds; Stratification; Top Predator	PACK-ICE SEALS; HYDRURGA-LEPTONYX; PRYDZ BAY; ANTARCTIC KRILL; ADELIE PENGUINS; ELEPHANT SEALS; FUR SEALS; BALAENOPTERA-PHYSALUS; EASTERN ANTARCTICA; EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA	The analysis of blubber fatty acids (FAs) is a useful tool to infer diet of mammals that live in remote regions where year-round studies are difficult. The FA may not be distributed uniformly within the blubber, which can have implications for dietary predictive studies. The aim of this study was to determine the FA composition in the blubber core of the Antarctic leopard seal, Hydrurga leptonyx, and evaluate the potential implications of FA stratification for dietary analysis. The blubber cores of 24 seals were sub-sectioned into outer, middle and inner layers and their FA were compared to those of their potential prey species. A vertical variation in FA composition was found across the whole blubber core of the leopard seal. 17 FAs were found at greater than trace amounts (>0.5%) across all samples and the most abundant were: C18:1 omega 9, C16:1, C22:6 omega 3, C16:0 and C18:1 omega 7, which accounted for approximately 70% of the total FA. Almost all FAs had a continuous gradient through the blubber. Principal Component Analysis confirmed separation between inner and outer layers while the middle layer was a transition. The stratification of the leopard seal blubber was similar to the general pattern observed in a variety of marine species: monounsaturated FA (MUFA) dominated the three layers being more abundant in the outer layer, polyunsaturated (PUFA) and saturated FA (SFA) were more abundant in the inner layer. Polyunsaturated FAs are of dietary origin and SFAS are chemically inert so they can be used as a long-term reserve, which suggest that the inner layer is the site of deposition of the FA obtained from diet. The influence of prey on the composition of the leopard seals' blubber was clearer in the inner layer, although neither outer nor inner layers exactly matched the FA of the potential prey. This suggests that there are other components influencing the FA composition of this predator; therefore, in order to carry out dietary analysis it is important to consider the stratification of blubber and to use the inner layer, where the influence of diet is more evident. This has significant implications for sampling methods in the field. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Guerrero, A. I.; Rogers, T.

We hypothesized that the diet of N. marionis shifts during its development, and that spatial variability in food availability results in differentiation in the diet signatures of specimens collected from various locations of the shelf waters around the PEI. Specimens were collected from nine stations (depth range 70 to 240 m) around the PEI at inter-island shelf (from west to east: upstream, between and downstream) and nearshore regions during austral autumn 2009. Stable isotope and fatty acid data both revealed spatial and developmental variations in the shrimp diet. Nearshore shrimp were more C-13-enriched than those from the inter-island region, suggesting increased kelp detritus entered the food web in the nearshore regions. The shrimp showed increases in delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures (and trophic position) with an increase in body size, resulting in distinctions between size classes that reflected shifts in their trophic niche through development. The fatty acid profiles similarly indicated distinctions in diet with increased shrimp size (in the deep regions), and spatial variability was evident in relation to region and depth. All shrimp contained large proportions of polyunsaturated and essential fatty acids, indicating that the quality of food consumed was similar between regions despite the diet variability. Our results provide new dietary information about a key species operating near the base of the food web at the highly productive PEI, and show that there were no areas of enhanced nutrition available to the shrimp. As such, there was no nutritional advantage to shrimp inhabiting any specific region around the PEI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Richoux, Nicole B.; Allan, E. Louise; Froneman, P.

While bacterial resistance to protistan ingestion has been relatively well understood, little is known about protistan digestion in which some ingested bacteria could not be digested in cells of major protistan grazers in the natural environment. Here we report the phylogenetic identities of digestion-resistant bacteria (DRB) that could survive starvation and form relatively stable associations with 11 marine and one freshwater ciliate species. Using clone library and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, we found that the protistan predators could host a high diversity of DRB, most of which represented novel bacterial taxa that have not been cultivated. The localization inside host cells, quantity, and viability of these bacteria were checked using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The DRB were affiliated with Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Parcubacteria (OD1), Planctomycetes, and Proteobacteria, with Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria being the most frequently occurring classes. The dominance of Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria corresponds well to a previous study of Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic data showing the widespread types of bacterial type VI and IV secretion systems (T6SS and T4SS) in these two taxa, suggesting a putatively significant role of secretion systems in promoting marine protist-bacteria associations. In the DRB assemblages, opportunistic bacteria such as Alteromonadaceae, Pseudoalteromonadaceae, and Vibrionaceae often presented with high proportions, indicating these bacteria could evade protistan grazing thus persist and accumulate in the community, which, however, contrasts with their well-known rarity in nature. This begs the question whether viral lysis is significant in killing these indigestible bacteria in microbial communities. Taken together, our study on the identity of DRB sheds new light on microbial interactions and generates further hypotheses including the potential importance of bacterial protein secretion systems in structuring bacterial community composition and functioning of "microbial black box" in aquatic environments.

Here, we compared two models: a biomass-based food-web model (Ecopath with Ecosim (EWE)) and a size -structured fish community model. The models were compared with respect to predicted ecological consequences of fishing to identify commonalities and differences in model predictions for the California Current fish community. We compared the models regarding direct and indirect responses to fishing on one or more species. The size-based model predicted a higher fishing mortality needed to reach maximum sustainable yield than EwE for most species. The size-based model also predicted stronger top -down effects of predator removals than EwE. In contrast, EwE predicted stronger bottom -up effects of forage fisheries removal. In both cases, the differences are due to the presumed degree of trophic overlap between juveniles of large -bodied fish and adult stages of forage fish. These differences highlight how each model's emphasis on distinct details of ecological processes affects its predictions, underscoring the importance of incorporating knowledge of model assumptions and limitation, possibly through using model ensembles, when providing model -based scientific advice to policy makers.

Conversely, there is limited understanding of the ecology of Gymnothorax polyuranodon, the lone representative of the family Muraenidae known to reside in freshwater systems. In this study, we used field-based encounters over a 3-year period in three short-steep-coastal-streams of the Australian Wet Tropics to find that most G.polyuranodon individuals (74%) occupied pools, with very few individuals observed in run (23%) or riffle (3%) mesohabitats. Moreover, G.polyuranodon positively selected microhabitats of slow flow (<0.05ms(-1)) and deep water (>80cm), while avoiding high flows (>0.5ms(-1)) and shallow water (<40cm depth). Morays exhibited strong preferences for boulders (73% of the immediate stream bed area occupied relative to 36% availability) with most individuals resting directly underneath large or very large boulders. Collecting and compiling records of this rare and elusive species over the long-term helped to reveal such habitat specialisation. Future management plans for G.polyuranodon should focus on preserving boulder interstices year-round and maintaining stream-sea connectivity to facilitate a diadromous life cycle.

Using time-depth recorders and 3D accelerometers, we addressed this question on six free-ranging Southern Elephant Seal (SES) females equipped on Kerguelen Island. We hypothesize that seals would initially increase their foraging time with distance to the foraging patches before reducing it for physiological reasons, regardless of the prey encountered. We expect that SES spends more time at depths where more Prey Catch Attempts (PCA) occur, that is at the bottom. We also hypothesize that bottom time should be related to both the seal body density and the swimming effort dedicated to catching prey, as we expect seals to be more active when catching prey. Finally, because oxygen is acquired at the surface only, we expect that recovery times increase with the duration of the previous dives. A total of 726% of PCA detected by accelerometer occurred at the bottom of the dive. At shallow depths (<300m), seals spent more time at the bottom in dives where PCA occurred compared to non-PCA dives. At deeper depths, SES had shorter bottom times in PCA dives due to higher swimming effort. When only dives associated with PCA were considered, the time spent at the bottom increased with the number of PCA. In addition, the closer the seal was to neutral buoyancy, the longer was the bottom duration. Body density, that is buoyancy, was found to be a critical factor in controlling variations in the dive duration through the swimming effort to access the prey at the bottom of the dive. Finally, post-dive surface intervals were related to the duration and swimming effort of the previous dive. This study reveals how a marine top predator adjusts the time spent at the bottom depending on its body density, prey encounter rate and prey accessibility. It also highlights that using the duration of the foraging phase as a proxy of foraging success can be seriously misleading in SES. Finally, the need to use an energetic approach with bio-logging technology to study behavioural ecology is emphasized.

Effects of predation depend on successional stage and recruitment rate in shallow benthic assemblages of the Southwestern Atlantic	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							MARINE EPIFAUNAL COMMUNITY; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; SESSILE COMMUNITIES; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; TROPHIC COMPLEXITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; ROCKY SHORES; REEF FISH	Although predation is broadly considered a key process shaping the structure of marine communities, recent studies reported inconsistent consumer effects on the structure of sessile benthic assemblages, even in subtropical areas where the density and diversity of predators can be high. In a subtropical area of the coast of Brazil, Southwestern Atlantic (23 degrees 48'S, 45 degrees 22'W), the effect of predators on subtidal benthic assemblages was tested by manipulating consumers access to experimental units. Community attributes were then measured at two different successional stages (30 and 100 days) and two spatial scales (within and among sites a few kilometers apart). Since recruitment can modulate predation, settlement rate and composition of recruits were also estimated at each site. Consumer effects were not general, depending on both site and successional stage. During early succession, and at sites where bare space was promptly occupied, predation did not reduce species richness, probably because settlement of a diverse species pool was intense. However, where recruitment rate was reduced and space occupation slower, predation decreased species richness as has been commonly observed in tropical areas. In later assemblages, and at sites where recruitment was intense, predation altered species composition, either facilitating poorer competitors or mediating competitive interactions between dominant species, as predicted by classical theory for temperate areas. This study shows that the outcome of predation in subtropical areas may vary, with effects either resembling those reported to the tropics or more aligned to classic observations in temperate areas. We advocate that variation between these extremes can be largely explained by recruitment dynamics.

Predictive Modelling to Identify Near-Shore, Fine-Scale Seabird Distributions during the Breeding Season	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SHAGS PHALACROCORAX-ARISTOTELIS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; HABITAT SELECTION; TOP PREDATOR; PREY; BEHAVIOR; PERFORMANCE; PREVALENCE; LOCATIONS; ECOLOGY	During the breeding season seabirds are constrained to coastal areas and are restricted in their movements, spending much of their time in near-shore waters either loafing or foraging. However, in using these areas they may be threatened by anthropogenic activities such as fishing, watersports and coastal developments including marine renewable energy installations. Although many studies describe large scale interactions between seabirds and the environment, the drivers behind near-shore, fine-scale distributions are not well understood. For example, Alderney is an important breeding ground for many species of seabird and has a diversity of human uses of the marine environment, thus providing an ideal location to investigate the near-shore fine-scale interactions between seabirds and the environment. We used vantage point observations of seabird distribution, collected during the 2013 breeding season in order to identify and quantify some of the environmental variables affecting the near-shore, fine-scale distribution of seabirds in Alderney's coastal waters. We validate the models with observation data collected in 2014 and show that water depth, distance to the intertidal zone, and distance to the nearest seabird nest are key predictors in the distribution of Alderney's seabirds. AUC values for each species suggest that these models perform well, although the model for shags performed better than those for auks and gulls. While further unexplained underlying localised variation in the environmental conditions will undoubtedly effect the fine-scale distribution of seabirds in near-shore waters we demonstrate the potential of this approach in marine planning and decision making.

Insects for breakfast and whales for dinner: the diet and body condition of dingoes on Fraser Island (K'gari)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CANIS-FAMILIARIS-DINGO; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; FLUCTUATING PREY POPULATIONS; NORTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA; DOMESTIC DOGS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; FEEDING ECOLOGY; ARID AUSTRALIA; LUPUS-DINGO; URBAN AREAS	Top-predators play stabilising roles in island food webs, including Fraser Island, Australia. Subsidising generalist predators with human-sourced food could disrupt this balance, but has been proposed to improve the overall health of the island's dingo (Canis lupus dingo) population, which is allegedly 'starving' or in 'poor condition'. We assess this hypothesis by describing the diet and health of dingoes on Fraser Island from datasets collected between 2001 and 2015. Medium-sized mammals (such as bandicoots) and fish were the most common food items detected in dingo scat records. Stomach contents records revealed additional information on diet, such as the occurrence of human-sourced foods. Trail camera records highlighted dingo utilisation of stranded marine fauna, particularly turtles and whales. Mean adult body weights were higher than the national average, body condition scores and abundant-excessive fat reserves indicated a generally ideal-heavy physical condition, and parasite loads were low and comparable to other dingo populations. These data do not support hypotheses that Fraser Island dingoes have restricted diets or are in poor physical condition. Rather, they indicate that dingoes on Fraser Island are capable of exploiting a diverse array of food sources which contributes to the vast majority of dingoes being of good-excellent physical condition.

Regional differences in plastic ingestion among Southern Ocean fur seals and albatrosses	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Marine debris; Arctocephalus; Diomedea; Thalassarche; Marion Island; Tristan da Cunha	ARCTOCEPHALUS-GAZELLA; LONGLINE FISHERY; MACQUARIE ISLAND; MARION ISLAND; SEABIRDS; PARTICLES; ATLANTIC; LITTER; POLLUTION; AFRICA	We provide data on regional differences in plastic ingestion for two,Southern Ocean top predators: Arctocephalus fur seals and albatrosses (Diomedeidae). Fur seals breeding on Macquarie Island in the 1990s excreted small (mainly 2-5 mm) plastic fragments, probably derived secondarily from myctophid fish. No plastic was found in the scats of these seals breeding on three islands in the southwest Indian and central South Atlantic Oceans, despite myctophids dominating their diets at these locations. Compared to recent reports of plastic ingestion by albatrosses off the east coast of South America, we confirm that plastic is seldom found in the stomachs of Thalassarche albatrosses off South Africa, but found no Diomedea albatrosses to contain plastic, compared to 26% off South America. The reasons for such regional differences are unclear, but emphasize the importance of reporting negative as well as positive records of plastic ingestion by marine biota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Biomass and composition of protistan grazers and heterotrophic bacteria in the Costa Rica Dome during summer 2010	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH			English	Article						heterotrophic protists; microzooplankton; nanozooplankton; community composition	NORTHERN BAJA-CALIFORNIA; EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC; EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; FOOD-WEB; PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; COASTAL WATERS; MARINE SYSTEMS; UPWELLING DOME; MICROZOOPLANKTON	We investigated biomass and composition of heterotrophic microbes in the Costa Rica Dome during June-July 2010 as part of a broader study of plankton trophic dynamics. Because picophytoplankton (, 2 mm) are known to dominate in this unique upwelling region, we hypothesized tight biomass relationships between size-determined predator-prey pairs (i.e. picoplankton-nano-grazers, nanoplankton-micro-grazers) within the microbial community. Integrated biomass of heterotrophic bacteria ranged from 180 to 487 mg C m(-2) and was significantly correlated with total autotrophic carbon. Heterotrophic protist (H-protist) biomass ranged more narrowly from 488 to 545 mg C m(-2), and was comprised of 60% dinoflagellates, 30% other flagellates and 11% ciliates. Nano-sized (<20 mu m) protists accounted for the majority (57%) of grazer biomass and were positively correlated with picoplankton, partially supporting our hypothesis, but nanoplankton and micro-grazers (>20 mu m) were not significantly correlated. The relative constancy of H-protist biomass among locations despite clear changes in integrated autotrophic biomass, Chl a, and primary production suggests that mesozooplankton may exert a tight top-down control on micro-grazers. Biomass-specific consumption rates of phytoplankton by protistan grazers suggest an instantaneous growth rate of 0.52 day(-1) for H-protists, similar to the growth rate of phytoplankton and consistent with a trophically balanced ecosystem dominated by piconanoplankton interactions.

Latitudinal variation in ecological opportunity and intraspecific competition indicates differences in niche variability and diet specialization of Arctic marine predators	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Beluga whale; generalist; marine mammals; ringed seal; stable isotopes; trophic ecology	SEALS PHOCA-HISPIDA; WHALES DELPHINAPTERUS-LEUCAS; STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; WESTERN HUDSON-BAY; BELUGA WHALES; INDIVIDUAL SPECIALIZATION; RINGED SEALS; PUSA-HISPIDA; FOOD-WEB	Individual specialization (IS), where individuals within populations irrespective of age, sex, and body size are either specialized or generalized in terms of resource use, has implications on ecological niches and food web structure. Niche size and degree of IS of near-top trophic-level marine predators have been little studied in polar regions or with latitude. We quantified the large-scale latitudinal variation of population-and individual-level niche size and IS in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis on 379 paired ringed seal liver and muscle samples and 124 paired beluga skin and muscle samples from eight locations ranging from the low to high Arctic. We characterized both within- and between-individual variation in predator niche size at each location as well as accounting for spatial differences in the isotopic ranges of potential prey. Total isotopic niche width (TINW) for populations of ringed seals and beluga decreased with increasing latitude. Higher TINW values were associated with greater ecological opportunity (i.e., prey diversity) in the prey fish community which mainly consists of Capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Sand lance (Ammodytes sp.) at lower latitudes and Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) at high latitudes. In beluga, their dietary consistency between tissues also known as the within-individual component (WIC) increased in a near 1: 1 ratio with TINW (slope = 0.84), suggesting dietary generalization, whereas the slope (0.18) of WIC relative to TINW in ringed seals indicated a high degree of individual specialization in ringed seal populations with higher TINWs. Our findings highlight the differences in TINW and level of IS for ringed seals and beluga relative to latitude as a likely response to large-scale spatial variation in ecological opportunity, suggesting species-specific variation in dietary plasticity to spatial differences in prey resources and environmental conditions in a rapidly changing ecosystem.

Faunal analysis of 152 uniquely identified taxa produced hierarchical synoptic tables of species associations with diagnostic indicators based on species fidelity. Twelve spatially coherent epibenthic megafaunal assemblages were identified, each with relatively sharp faunal boundaries and unique species attributes. These assemblages were shown a posteriori through ANOSIM to have statistically different species compositions, and were nested within three major regional-scale faunal groups: (I) the continental shelf of the Tail of the Grand Bank, typified by the sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa and the sand dollar Echinarachnius parma; (II) the upper slope of the Grand Bank and top of Flemish Cap, typified by the sponges Radiella hemisphaerica and Iophon piceum and the sea star Ceramaster granularis; and (III) the lower slope of the Grand Bank and Flemish Cap, typified by the sea urchin Phormosoma placenta, and the sea pens Anthoptilum grandiflorum and Funiculina quadrangularis. Comparisons with literature on benthic species associations from a half century ago suggest that the assemblages identified herein have persisted in the area at least for decades. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) identified a well-defined biological gradient along the first axis with very high species turn-over. Ten environmental variables (including Trawling Intensity) were significantly correlated with the ordinated data. At one extreme the continental shelf faunal group (I) was associated with shallow depth (mostly, less than 200 m), coarse sediments and cold and fresh water associated with the Labrador Current. At the other extreme the lower slope faunal group (III; stations below 500-600 m throughout the study area) was strongly associated with deep water, muddy sediments, and warmer and saltier water. Conditional tests under a step-wise model identified the percentage of mud as having the greatest explanatory power (40%) of the tested environmental variables. Trawling Intensity explained 11% of the variation in the full data set in marginal tests. Species richness in the deep water assemblages (Cluster III) was significantly and negatively correlated with fishing intensity. The species most directly associated with high trawling intensity in the DCA were the hard-shelled scavenging and predatory gastropods and a thick-shelled bivalve, consistent with expectations based on the trawling impact literature. Our study fills a critical knowledge gap in this important fishing area, and our novel regional-scale maps of the epibenthic assemblages will facilitate the development of ecosystem-based models linking benthic and pelagic systems and inform biodiversity conservation.

Understanding the consequences of these changes is vital to their successful conservation, yet few studies have experimentally investigated how producer diversity affects the stability of higher trophic levels. Here, we show that producer diversity, when manipulated as the only independent variable in the presence of natural top-down forces, increases the stability of consumer abundance, biomass and diversity in a benthic marine community. Using four macroalgal species (Codium fragile, Gracilaria tikvahiae, Gracilaria vermiculophylla and Gymnogongrus griffithsiae), we manipulated producer diversity (identity and richness) in a substitutive design to create seven treatments. Our treatments included four monocultures, two 3-species mixtures that differed only by including either the native or invasive Gracilaria and the complete four-species mixture. We followed the week-to-week dynamics of producer and consumer communities in each treatment concurrently for 12weeks and quantified their temporal stability. We found that higher producer diversity increased the stability of a diverse, productive consumer community.Producer biomass production did not affect consumer production or diversity, suggesting that producer diversity was solely responsible for driving the mechanisms underlying the observed multitrophic diversity-stability relationships. Taken together, our results indicate thathigher producer diversitydirectly increased consumer diversity by increasing overyielding and decreasing the temporal variance of this response variable and that this increased consumer diversity enhanced consumer stability via increased asynchrony among consumers.Synthesis. Our results suggest that the effects of producer diversity propagate upwards to maintain diversity and productivity at higher trophic levels, and thereby enhance the overall stability of food webs.

Limited differences in fish and benthic communities and possible cascading effects inside and outside a protected marine area in Sagres (SW Portugal)	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Marine protected area (MPA); Fish community; Benthic community: protection impact	URCHIN PARACENTROTUS-LIVIDUS; WEIGHT-LENGTH RELATIONSHIPS; SEA-URCHIN; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; TOP-DOWN; ALGAL ASSEMBLAGES; HABITAT STRUCTURE; FEEDING ECOLOGY; POINT COUNT; FOOD CHOICE	Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a relatively recent fisheries management and conservation tool for conservation of marine ecosystems and serve as experimental grounds to assess trophic cascade effects in areas were fishing is restricted to some extent. A series of descriptive field studies were performed to assess fish and benthic communities between two areas within a newly established MPA in SW Portugal. We characterized benthic macroalgal composition and determined the size, density and biomass of the main benthic predatory and herbivorous fish species as well as the main benthic herbivorous invertebrates to assess indications of top-down control on the phytobenthic assemblages. Fish species were identical inside and outside the MPA, in both cases Sarpa salpa was the most abundant fish herbivore and Diplodus spp. accounted for the great majority of the benthic predators. However, size and biomass of D. spp. were higher inside than outside the MPA. The main herbivorous invertebrate was the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, which was smaller and predominantly showing a crevice-dwelling behaviour in the MPA. In addition, P. lividus size frequency distribution showed a unimodal pattern outside and a bimodal pattern inside the MPA. We found significant differences in the algal assemblages between inside and outside the MPA, with higher abundance of turf and foliose algae inside, and articulated calcareous and corticated macrophytes outside the MPA, but no differences in the invasive Asparagopsis spp. The obtained results show differences in predatory fish and benthic community structure, but not in species richness, inside and outside the MPA. We hypothesize these differences lead to variation in species interactions: directly through predation and indirectly via affecting sea urchins behavioural patterns, predators might drive changes in macroalgal assemblages via trophic cascade in the study area. However due to non-biological differences between the two areas it is difficult to suggest that the MPA causes increased biological parameters of targeted species and to assess predatory control and trophic cascade effects in areas where fishing pressure is reduced. It is therefor advisable to design MPAs so that their impacts can be scientifically evaluated in a proper fashion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, previous knowledge on the distributional patterns of cetacean species in relation to physical oceanography is usually limited to a small fraction of each species' range because of their vast distribution and infrequency of encountering many species. We carried out comprehensive analyzes on the distributions of small odontocetes covering almost the entire North Pacific Ocean. Using data from over 300000 nautical miles (approximate to 555600km) of dedicated sighting surveys and 7000 school sightings of 14 small odontocete species, which have accumulated for approximately a quarter of a century, we describe interspecific habitat differences in small odontocetes with respect to physical oceanography. Multivariate analyzes were used to discriminate the 14 species into four ecological groups: (i) Subtropical Domain species; (ii) Subarctic Boundary species; (iii) Transitional Domain species; and (iv) Subarctic Domain species. By comparing environmental variables in their habitats with variables indicative of water mass and frontal structures, the four species groups were further divided into several subgroups. Groups at higher latitudes comprised fewer species than those at lower latitudes, while species diversity was maximal at lower and intermediate latitudes. Our findings indicate that large-scale oceanographic structures are important determinants for the present patterns in biogeography and species diversity of small odontocetes.

However, the influence of size structure on trophic transfer remains poorly quantified in the field. Here, we examine how the size diversity of prey (nano-microplankton) and predators (mesozooplankton) influence trophic transfer efficiency (using biomass ratio as a proxy) in natural marine ecosystems. Our results support previous studies on single trophic levels: transfer efficiency decreases with increasing prey size diversity and is enhanced with greater predator size diversity. We further show that communities with low nano-microplankton size diversity and high mesozooplankton size diversity tend to occur in warmer environments with low nutrient concentrations, thus promoting trophic transfer to higher trophic levels in those conditions. Moreover, we reveal an interactive effect of predator and prey size diversities: the positive effect of predator size diversity becomes influential when prey size diversity is high. Mechanistically, the negative effect of prey size diversity on trophic transfer may be explained by unicellular size-based metabolic constraints as well as trade-offs between growth and predation avoidance with size, whereas increasing predator size diversity may enhance diet niche partitioning and thus promote trophic transfer. These findings provide insights into size-based theories of ecosystem functioning, with implications for ecosystem predictive models.

J	van Eeden, R; Reid, T; Ryan, PG; Pichegru, L				van Eeden, Rowen; Reid, Timothy; Ryan, Peter G.; Pichegru, Lorien			Fine-scale foraging cues for African penguins in a highly variable marine environment	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Foraging ecology; Thermocline variability; GPS tracking; Dive behaviour; Top predator	THICK-BILLED MURRES; SOUTH-AFRICA; ALGOA BAY; SPHENISCUS-DEMERSUS; AGULHAS CURRENT; KING PENGUINS; BERING-SEA; MESOSCALE EDDIES; DIVING BEHAVIOR; TOP PREDATOR	Breeding seabirds often need to locate prey in spatially confined search areas on short temporal scales. Ocean physical features such as thermoclines are used as foraging cues since they concentrate and thus increase the likelihood of locating prey. However, in highly variable environments, it is less well understood how these features act as foraging cues. African penguins Spheniscus demersus foraging in Algoa Bay, South Africa, were fitted with GPS-TD loggers to determine the cues they use to locate prey on fine temporal (< 24 h) and spatial (< 100 km) scales in a bay with changing thermal properties. African penguins showed a preference for cooler surface waters associated with upwelling, avoiding warm surface waters associated with the Agulhas Current. Thermocline presence and characteristics were an important foraging cue; penguins consistently foraged at and below the thermocline even though its depth and gradient shifted over time. Dive ascent and descent rates were quicker in the presence of thermoclines with strong gradients, which form a distinct separation between the warm upper mixed layer and the cooler lower layer. Foraging dives occurred predominantly below the thermocline, while search dives occurred around the thermocline depth. Penguins dived deeper in search of prey when there was no thermocline. Our results demonstrate that top predators can cope with highly variable environments by adjusting their search strategy to target environments suited to their main prey.

These reefs have been extensively studied since the 1980' s, however those studies focused mainly on coral coverage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the coral reefs of the island, not only by the coverage of the substrate but also the composition of fish, invertebrates and reef complexity. A total of 17 sites around the island were sampled in July 2013 and in February-March 2014. At each site, we evaluated three depths (4-8 m, 9-12 m and 13-16 m), where three 10m long transects were sampled. Turf algae was the predominant substrate cover with 38.18 +/- 5.58 %. The crustose calcareous algae (Order Corallinales) had a 28.12 +/- 5.85 % cover and live coral was 18.64 +/- 3.55 %, with Porites lobata as the main reef builder. A total of 18 taxa of macroinvertebrates were observed in the study sites, of which 56 % of the species were not abundant, 33 % were common, and the sea urchin Diadema mexicanum was the only dominant species. The density of lobsters of the genus Panulirus was 388 +/- 385 ind ha(-1), which is the highest density reported in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Also we observed high densities of the sea cucumber Isostichopus fuscus (550 ind ha(-1)), which has a high commercial value. We recorded 45 338 fish individuals, distributed in 93 species, with an average of 1.2 +/- 8.5 tn ha(-1). From the total of species, 51 % were uncommon, 31 % common, 11 % predominant and 8 % occasional. The fish community at Isla del Coco is represented by a large number of carnivorous species, followed by top predators, herbivores and planktivorous species. According to the fish categories of the IUCN Red List, 16 % of species are in threatened categories and represent 25 % of the total sampled biomass. When comparing with studies carried out from 1987 to the present, the recovery in coral cover over time is evident, mainly due to: 1) a decrease in the pressure of the bioerosive action of D. mexicanum; and 2) the conservation actions that have been taken on the island. This has been translated in complex and more rugose reefs. Isla del Coco reefs are healthy, with functional and complex food webs; where species of high commercial value have large populations. The effectiveness of conservation and management activities in Isla del Coco has resulted in the recovery of the reef communities. Rev. Biol. Trop. 64 (Suppl. 1): S153-S175. Epub 2016 Febrary 01.

Here, we integrate biologging, satellite remote-sensing and ensemble ecological niche models (EENMs) to identify predictable foraging habitats for a globally important population of the grey-headed albatross (GHA) Thalassarche chrysostoma Location Bird Island, South Georgia; Southern Atlantic Ocean. Methods GPS and geolocation-immersion loggers were used to track at-sea movements and activity patterns of GHA over two breeding seasons (n = 55; brood-guard). Immersion frequency (landings per 10-min interval) was used to define foraging events. EENM combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) identified the biophysical conditions characterizing the locations of foraging events, using time-matched oceanographic predictors (Sea Surface Temperature, SST; chlorophyll a, chl-a; thermal front frequency, TFreq; depth). Model performance was assessed through iterative cross-validation and extrapolative performance through cross-validation among years. Results Predictable foraging habitats identified by EENM spanned neritic (<500 m), shelf break and oceanic waters, coinciding with a set of persistent biophysical conditions characterized by particular thermal ranges (3-8 degrees C, 12-13 degrees C), elevated primary productivity (chl-a > 0.5 mg m(-3)) and frequent manifestation of mesoscale thermal fronts. Our results confirm previous indications that GHA exploit enhanced foraging opportunities associated with frontal systems and objectively identify the APFZ as a region of high foraging habitat suitability. Moreover, at the spatial and temporal scales investigated here, the performance of multi-model ensembles was superior to that of single-algorithm models, and cross-validation among years indicated reasonable extrapolative performance. Main conclusions EENM techniques are useful for integrating the predictions of several single-algorithm models, reducing potential bias and increasing confidence in predictions. Our analysis highlights the value of EENM for use with movement data in identifying at-sea habitats of wide-ranging marine predators, with clear implications for conservation and management.

Foraging behaviour and energy budgets of sea snakes: insights from implanted data loggers	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						sea snakes; foraging behaviour; diving behaviour; ectothermy; energetics; top predators; coral reefs; bio-logging	PELAMIS-PLATURUS; DIVING BEHAVIOR; LATICAUDA-SPP.; CALEDONIAN LAGOON; KRAITS; PATTERNS; DETERMINANTS; TRANSITIONS; ECOSYSTEMS; ECTOTHERMY	Information on the foraging behaviour of sea snakes has the potential to clarify adaptive pathways involved in the evolutionary invasion of marine habitats by terrestrial vertebrates. However, logistical obstacles have precluded studies in this field. To obtain preliminary data of diving behaviour, we surgically implanted temperature-depth loggers into two sympatric, amphibious, benthic foraging sea krait species from New Caledonia. Based on logger recovery from three snakes (1 Laticauda laticaudata and 2L.saintgironsi), we obtained data on a total of 1850 dives carried out over eight foraging trips and 39.6 days at sea. Almost 99% of dives were <30m deep. Average dive depth was 10.7 +/- 7.0m, but snakes dived as deep as 82.6m. Maximum dive duration was 123.7min. At sea, snakes dived continuously, with over 90% of surface recovery periods lasting less than 3min in L.saintgironsi (n=1). Periods at the surface (between successive dives) were longer at night than by day, plausibly reflecting more intense hunting activity by the snake. Locomotor speed, as measured by the rate of vertical descent or ascent during diving, was low (0.15ms(-1)). In combination with other data on these species, we estimate that metabolic expenditure was about 10 times greater while the snakes were at sea than on land; and their overall field metabolic rate (70-145kJkg(-1)day(-1)) was an order of magnitude less than has been reported for diving endotherms. Despite low sample sizes, our study shows that implanted data loggers can provide novel insights into sea snake biology. Our data emphasize the behavioural and ecological consequences of ectothermy for secondary marine vertebrates.

Sensory cues of a top-predator indirectly control a reef fish mesopredator	OIKOS			English	Article							MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; CORAL-REEF; VISUAL INFORMATION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; INSPECTION BEHAVIOR; PREY INTERACTIONS; EUROPEAN MINNOWS; ATLANTIC SALMON; COMMUNITIES; GROWTH	Behavioural trophic cascades highlight the importance of indirect/risk effects in the maintenance of healthy trophic-level links in complex ecosystems. However, there is limited understanding on how the loss of indirect top-down control can cascade through the food-web to modify lower level predator-prey interactions. Using a reef fish food-web, our study examines behavioural interactions among predators to assess how fear elicited by top-predator cues (visual and chemical stimuli) can alter mesopredator behaviour and modify their interaction with resource prey. Under experimental conditions, the presence of any cue (visual, chemical, or both) from the top-predator (coral trout Plectropomus leopardus) strongly restricted the distance swum, area explored and foraging activity of the mesopredator (dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus), while indirectly triggering a behavioural release of the resource prey (recruits of the damselfish Pomacentrus chrysurus). Interestingly, the presence of a large non-predator species (thicklip wrasse Hemigymnus melapterus) also mediated the impact of the mesopredator on prey, as it provoked mesopredators to engage in an inspection' behaviour, while significantly reducing their feeding activity. Our study describes for the first time a three-level behavioural cascade of coral reef fish and stresses the importance of indirect interactions in marine food-webs.

The Falkland Islands hold the largest number of breeding gentoo penguins. Yet knowledge of gentoo penguin diet at the Falklands is limited to either broad taxonomic divisions of prey items or dietary samples collected only on a single day. This study is the first to investigate gentoo penguin diet at Cow Bay, Falklands, to the species level, over repeated sampling intervals during the breeding period. Through stomach content analysis, we determined diet over a large temporal scale (2002/2003/2004-2011/2012/2013) and between the guard and crSche periods of chick rearing. The principle prey item by reconstituted mass was rock cod fish Patagonotothen spp., for all periods (47-78 %) except that of the 2012/2013 crSche period (19 %) when Falkland herring Sprattus fugensis made up the bulk of the diet (52 %). Of the cephalopods recovered, Patagonian squid Doryteuthis gahi was prominent (1-24 %), while crustaceans contributed negligibly to gentoo penguin diet. Our findings revealed that gentoo penguins breeding at the Falkland Islands were primarily demersal foragers with an ability for pelagic feeding. Diet choice appears to reflect prey availability.

The use of animal-borne camera loggers, however, is proving useful in this regard as researchers can directly observe species and habitat-associated interactions. During an ongoing study investigating the foraging ecology of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at the Falkland Islands, we observed the first attempted underwater intraspecific kleptoparasitism event for a penguin. This was revealed through a bird deployed with an animal-borne camera logger. Although unsuccessful in its attempt, the new reported behaviour highlights a novel interaction and further demonstrates the value of cameras in better understanding the ecology of marine vertebrates.

Both periods are marked by a series of biotic crises including the most catastrophic of such events, the end-Permian mass extinction, which eventually led to a major turnover from typical Palaeozoic faunas and floras to those that are emblematic for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Here we review patterns in Permian-Triassic bony fishes, a group whose evolutionary dynamics are understudied. Based on data from primary literature, we analyse changes in their taxonomic diversity and body size (as a proxy for trophic position) and explore their response to Permian-Triassic events. Diversity and body size are investigated separately for different groups of Osteichthyes (Dipnoi, Actinistia, Palaeopterygii', Subholostei', Holostei, Teleosteomorpha), within the marine and freshwater realms and on a global scale (total diversity) as well as across palaeolatitudinal belts. Diversity is also measured for different palaeogeographical provinces. Our results suggest a general trend from low osteichthyan diversity in the Permian to higher levels in the Triassic. Diversity dynamics in the Permian are marked by a decline in freshwater taxa during the Cisuralian. An extinction event during the end-Guadalupian crisis is not evident from our data, but palaeopterygians' experienced a significant body size increase across the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary and these fishes upheld their position as large, top predators from the Late Permian to the Late Triassic. Elevated turnover rates are documented at the Permian-Triassic boundary, and two distinct diversification events are noted in the wake of this biotic crisis, a first one during the Early Triassic (dipnoans, actinistians, palaeopterygians', subholosteans') and a second one during the Middle Triassic (subholosteans', neopterygians). The origination of new, small taxa predominantly among these groups during the Middle Triassic event caused a significant reduction in osteichthyan body size. Neopterygii, the clade that encompasses the vast majority of extant fishes, underwent another diversification phase in the Late Triassic. The Triassic radiation of Osteichthyes, predominantly of Actinopterygii, which only occurred after severe extinctions among Chondrichthyes during the Middle-Late Permian, resulted in a profound change within global fish communities, from chondrichthyan-rich faunas of the Permo-Carboniferous to typical Mesozoic and Cenozoic associations dominated by actinopterygians. This turnover was not sudden but followed a stepwise pattern, with leaps during extinction events.

Mercury levels assessment and its relationship with oxidative stress biomarkers in children from three localities in Yucatan, Mexico	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mercury; Oxidative stress; MDA; GSH; PON-1; Multivariate analysis	BIOLOGICAL MONITORING VALUES; PARAOXONASE ACTIVITY; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; METHYLMERCURY; GLUTATHIONE; METALS; URINE; HAIR; RISK	Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that is released into the environment from geologic and anthropogenic sources. Once it enters an organism, it generates several toxicity mechanisms and oxidative stress has been proposed as the main one. Metal susceptibility is greater in children, which is a result of their physiology and behavior. In Yucatan, Mexico, burning of unregulated garbage dumps and household trash, ingestion of top marine predators, and pottery manufacturing are among the conditions that could promote Hg exposure. However, for Yucatan, there are no published studies that report Hg levels and associated oxidative stress status in children. Therefore, this study aimed to assess Hg levels in blood and urine and oxidative stress biomarkers levels in a sample of 107 healthy children from three localities in Yucatan, Mexico, as well as investigate the relationship between these parameters. Hg was detected in 11(10.28%) of blood samples and 38 (35.51%) of urine samples collected from the participating children. Fourteen subjects showed Hg above recommended levels. The oxidative stress biomarkers were slightly elevated in comparison with other studies and were statistically different between the sampling sites. No linear correlation between Hg levels and oxidative stress,biomarkers was found. Nevertheless, exploratory univariate and multivariate analysis showed non-linear relations among the measured variables. Globally, the study provides, for the first time, information regarding Hg levels and their relationship with oxidative stress biomarkers in a juvenile population from Mexico's southeast (Yucatan) region. In agreement with worldwide concern about Hg, this study should stimulate studies on metal monitoring in humans (especially children) among scientists working in Mexico, the establishment of polices for its regulation, and the reduction of human health risks.

PCB pollution continues to impact populations of orcas and other dolphins in European waters	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PORPOISES PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; PACIFIC KILLER WHALES; STENELLA-COERULEOALBA; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; STRIPED DOLPHIN; ORGANOCHLORINE CONCENTRATIONS; CETACEAN MORBILLIVIRUS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS	Organochlorine (OC) pesticides and the more persistent polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have well-established dose-dependent toxicities to birds, fish and mammals in experimental studies, but the actual impact of OC pollutants on European marine top predators remains unknown. Here we show that several cetacean species have very high mean blubber PCB concentrations likely to cause population declines and suppress population recovery. In a large pan-European meta-analysis of stranded (n = 929) or biopsied (n = 152) cetaceans, three out of four species:-striped dolphins (SDs), bottlenose dolphins (BNDs) and killer whales (KWs) had mean PCB levels that markedly exceeded all known marine mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. Some locations (e.g. western Mediterranean Sea, south-west Iberian Peninsula) are global PCB "hotspots" for marine mammals. Blubber PCB concentrations initially declined following a mid-1980s EU ban, but have since stabilised in UK harbour porpoises and SDs in the western Mediterranean Sea. Some small or declining populations of BNDs and KWs in the NE Atlantic were associated with low recruitment, consistent with PCB-induced reproductive toxicity. Despite regulations and mitigation measures to reduce PCB pollution, their biomagnification in marine food webs continues to cause severe impacts among cetacean top predators in European seas.

Ecological influences of more than 90% of the 338 known species of extant ocean megafauna are unstudied and thus unknown. The most widely known effect of those few species that have been studied is direct prey limitation, which occurs through consumption and risk avoidance behavior. Consumer-prey interactions result in indirect effects that extend through marine ecosystems to other species and ecological processes. Marine megafauna transport energy, nutrients, and other materials vertically and horizontally through the oceans, often over long distances. The functional relationships between these various ecological impacts and megafauna population densities, in the few well-studied cases, are characterized by phase shifts and hysteresis.

Population recovery was not immediate after hunting ceased in 1962. The population was stable until 1989, and since then has grown at an annual rate of increase of 5.7%. Along with this growth there was an increase of the juvenile fraction and changes in the social composition of colonies, which could be related to changes in some population vital rates. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the survivorship pattern of Otaria flavescens through time. The ultimate goal was to contribute to a better understanding of changes that could have operated on the ecosystem after the decline and recovery of one of the main marine top-predators in the southern South Atlantic Ocean. The comparisons of survivorship curves of males and females, obtained from the life tables of two periods with different population trends: 1981-1987 (stationary) and 2000-2008 (recovering), showed that there were differences in survivorship between sexes, where recent female age-specific survival was higher than that of males at any age. The comparison of survivorship between periods showed differences in both sexes. Both juveniles and adults, both male and female, from the recent period showed higher survival than those of the 1980's decade. This improvement in survivorship could be one of the essential factors that drove population recovery in the last decades. Here we discuss the possible hypotheses of which factors could have changed in the ecosystem to favour juvenile and adult survivorship, such as an increase in the availability of food recourses, a decrease of exogenous mortality causes, or a combination of both factors.

Setting an ecological baseline prior to the bottom-up establishment of a marine protected area in Santorini Island, Aegean Sea	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Marine protected area; fish assemblages; benthic communities; rocky infralittoral; Posidonia oceanica meadows; ecological indicators; Aegean Sea; alien species	POSIDONIA-OCEANICA MEADOWS; EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA; FISH-ASSEMBLAGE; RESERVES; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; SEAGRASS; HABITATS; PATTERNS; SERVICES	Since 2010, a bottom-up initiative has been launched in Santorini Island (Aegean Sea, Eastern Mediterranean) for the establishment of the first fully protected marine protected area in the Cyclades, aiming at improving fisheries and enhancing responsible recreational uses at sea. Following discussions with local small-scale fishermen and divers, two sites along the southern and south-eastern coasts of the island were suggested as suitable to this end. In 2012, a baseline study was conducted in these areas to assess their state and provide an ecological snapshot that would enable sound designation and monitoring. Several ad hoc indices and metrics were applied, taking into account structural and functional features of the upper infralittoral algae and Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds. An integrated assessment of the infralittoral fish assemblages and their associated benthic communities was also performed. Our most important findings were: (i) the low total fish biomass and the absence of adult top predators, indicating overfishing; (ii) the overgrazing effects of the abundant alien herbivore spinefoot fishes (Siganus spp.), as reflected by the abnormal structure of the algal communities; (iii) the scarcity of indications of pollution or other direct anthropogenic pressures, as indicated by the good environmental status of the P. oceanica meadows and the upper infralittoral vegetation; and (iv) the presence of a rich diversity of species and habitats, especially along the Akrotiri Peninsula and the wider volcanic Caldera. These findings provide useful insights on the strengths and weaknesses of the study area and are discussed together with their implications for protection and management.

The observed expansion of the red lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758), in the Caribbean represents one of the most rapid marine fish invasions in the history. The invasion rate of this top predator has resulted in a marked negative effect on local fish populations in the Caribbean by impacting local biodiversity. The main aim of this work was to conduct the morphological identification of prey items from the lionfish diet, and to determine the spatio-temporal variation of the lionfish diet composition in different sites of the Mexican Caribbean, to have a better knowledge of how this invasive species is impacting local species of commercial or ecological importance in the region. Materials and methods. The Mexican Caribbean study area was divided in three zones; North (one locality Isla Contoy), Central (three locations Xpu-Ha, Akumal and X'Cacel), and South (two locations Banco Chinchorro and Xcalak). The fish were collected, from different habitats, using SCUBA diving and Hawaiian harpoon. Collected fish were taxonomically identified, measured for total length (TL) and standard length (SL), and weighed to the nearest gram. Prey items were identified using a dissection microscope. After identification, prey items were separated, counted, and weighted individually. Finally, statistical analyses were made for all the samples using this study database, containing predators and prey items. Results. A total of 76 prey species were identified in 962 lionfish stomachs; 47 of them represented fishes and 29-crustaceans. Fishes of families Pomacentridae, Labridae, and Scaridae were the most abundant diet components of lionfish. Rhynchocinetidae, Penaeidae, and Solenoceridae were the most representative Crustaceans families among the prey items. Molluscs were present as diet components only as incidental food. Conclusion. Red lionfish, known for its high competitive capacity, preyed more intensively on fishes than on crustaceans. Therefore, it is evident that the lionfish presence in the Mexican Caribbean may affect mainly the local population of reef fishes. The presently reported results contribute to a better understanding of the red lionfish invasion in the Caribbean.

Over-harvesting drastically reduced the population of polar bears in the Barents Sea region from about 1870 to 1970. After harvesting was stopped-in 1956 in Russia and 1973 in Norway-the population grew to an estimated 2650 individuals (95% confidence interval 1900-3600) in 2004, and maternity denning in the Svalbard Archipelago became more widely distributed. During recent decades, the population has faced challenges from a variety of new anthropogenic impacts: a range of pollutants, an increasing level of human presence and activity as well as changes in ice conditions. Contaminants bioaccumulate up through the marine food web, culminating in this top predator that consumes ringed, bearded and harp seals. Females with small cubs use land-fast sea ice for hunting and are therefore vulnerable to disturbance by snowmobile drivers. Sea-ice diminution, associated with climate change, reduces polar bears' access to denning areas and could negatively affect the survival of cubs. There are clear linkages between population biology and current anthropogenic threats, and we suggest that future research and management should focus on and take into consideration the combined effects of several stressors on polar bears.

In this study, we investigated the foraging responses of two seabird species, surface-foraging red-legged kittiwakes Rissa brevirostris (hereafter, RLKI) and pursuit-diving foraging thick-billed murres Uria lomvia (TBMU) to different marine environmental conditions over 2 years. At-sea distributions of RLKI and TBMU breeding on St. George Island, the largest seabird colony in the region, were recorded using GPS loggers, and blood samples were taken to examine their physiological condition and isotopic foraging niche in a given year. Between the study years, winter ice retreated earlier and summer water temperatures were relatively warmer in 2014 compared to those in 2013. RLKI foraging occurred mostly over the oceanic basin in both years. TBMU, however, foraged mostly over the shelf but showed a relatively higher use of the shelf break and oceanic basin in 2013. The foraging distances from the colony peaked at 250-300 km in 2013 and bimodally at 150-250 and 300-350 km in 2014 for RLKI and tended to be farther in 2013 compared to those in 2014 for TBMU. Plasma levels of corticosterone did not differ between the years in RLKI but differed in TBMU, showing higher levels of physiological stress incurred by murres in 2013, the year of relatively cooler sea surface temperatures with later sea-ice retreat. delta N-13 (a proxy of trophic level of prey) did not differ between the years in either RLKI or TBMU. These results suggest that the response of ecosystem dynamics to climate variability in the southeastern Bering Sea may differ between the ocean basin and continental shelf regions, which, in turn, may generate differential responses in seabirds relying on those habitats for foraging.

We examined the characteristics of foraging behavior of two sympatric congeneric diving seabird: common (Uria aalge: hereafter COMUs) and thick-billed (U. lomvia: hereafter TBMUs) murres breeding on St. George Island, located in the seasonal sea-ice region of the Bering Sea. We investigated their foraging trip and flight durations, diel patterns of dive depth, and underwater wing strokes, along with wing morphology and blood stable isotope signatures and stress hormones. Acceleration-temperature-depth loggers were attached to chick-guarding birds, and data were obtained from 7 COMUs and 12 TBMUs. Both species showed similar mean trip duration (13.2 h for COMUs and 10.5 h for TBMUs) and similar diurnal patterns of diving (frequent dives to various depths in the daytime and less frequent dives to shallow depths in the night-time). During the daytime, the dive depths of COMUs had two peaks in shallow (18.1 m) and deep (74.2 m) depths, while those of TBMUs were 20.2 m and 59.7 m. COMUs showed more frequent wing strokes during the bottom phase of dives (1.90 s(-1)) than TBMUs (1.66 s(-1)). Fish occurred more frequently in the bill loads of COMUs (85 %) than those of TBMUs (56 %). The delta N-15 value of blood was significantly higher in COMUs (14.5 parts per thousand) than in TBMUs (13.1 parts per thousand). The relatively small wing area (0.053 m(2)) of COMUs compared to TBMUs (0.067 m(2)) may facilitate their increased agility while foraging and allow them to capture more mobile prey such as larger fishes that inhabit deeper depths. These differences in food resource use may lead to the differential responses of the two murre species to marine environmental changes in the Bering Sea.

Finding these patchy food sources and being first to a food patch could provide a significant competitive advantage. Our hypothesis is that food patches have specific sound signatures that marine predators could detect and that acoustic sources and animal sensory capabilities may contribute to competition dynamics. Preliminary analysis shows that diving gannets have a distinct spectral signature between 80 and 200 Hz, which falls within the hearing sensitivity of large pelagic fishes. Therefore, we suggest that diving birds may contribute to the sound signatures of food aggregations, linking competition dynamics both above and below the water surface.	[Radford, C.

Longnose Gar Lepisosteus osseus is a large, ubiquitous top predator in fresh and saline waters of the eastern United States. Even though the species is common, their basic biology has been largely uncharacterized in brackish and marine waters. Specimens were collected from two estuaries: Winyah Bay and Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, from May 2012 through July 2013 to examine age, growth, and reproduction in tidally influenced systems. This species is fairly long-lived, with maximum ages of 17 and 25 years for males and females, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth model yielded significantly higher growth rates for males than for females. Reproductive histology and the gonadosomatic index indicated that Longnose Gars exhibit determinate fecundity and spawn in late spring following a long development period during fall and winter. These life history parameters provide valuable insight into the basic biology of Longnose Gars and into how they function in estuarine environments. Further research on the precise timing and location of spawning movement, as well as daily movement patterns of this species, would provide a more comprehensive knowledge of Longnose Gar reproductive biology.

An exception to the rule: top-down control of a coral reef macroinvertebrate community by a tropical spiny lobster	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article							PANULIRUS-GUTTATUS LATREILLE; TROPHIC CASCADES; SEA-URCHINS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; DIADEMA-ANTILLARUM; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; MASS MORTALITY; MARINE RESERVE; ROCK LOBSTER; ARGUS	In temperate habitats, predation by lobsters creates trophic cascades that reverberate through benthic communities. However, the influence of lobsters on tropical benthic communities is thought to be minimal due to higher prey diversity and the mobility and broad diet of lobsters. We hypothesized that this would not be the case for the spotted spiny lobster (Panulirus guttatus Latreille, 1804), an obligate, philopatric dweller of Caribbean coral reefs. Our study took place in the Florida Keys (USA), where we examined the gut contents of wild lobsters, conducted laboratory experiments on lobster prey selection and foraging effectiveness in rubble, and manipulated lobster density on isolated patch reefs to examine the effects of lobster predation on macroinvertebrate prey over a 3-yr period. We found P. guttatus to be a generalist carnivore that consumed a suite of macroinvertebrates, including important reef herbivores (e.g., herbivorous crabs, gastropods, and urchins) that comprised >60% of its diet. Higher densities of P. guttatus exerted strong top-down control over the abundance and composition of macroinvertebrate prey in rubble substrates on patch reefs, but not prey living in substrates dominated by macroalgae. Lobster foraging success in rubble also depended on rubble size; lobsters extracted prey from and overturned rubble more easily when rubble was smaller. The abundance and high site fidelity of predatory P. guttatus appears to provide the necessary conditions for top-down control of prey in coral reef rubble zones, an effect similar to the powerful influence of lobster predation observed in temperate ecosystems.

J	Kakuschke, A; Griesel, S				Kakuschke, Antje; Griesel, Simone			Essential and Toxic Elements in Blood Samples of Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina) from the Islands Helgoland (North Sea) and Anholt (Baltic Sea): A Comparison Study with Urbanized Areas	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; MARINE TOP PREDATORS; IN-VITRO; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; INTERSPECIES DIFFERENCES; TRACE-ELEMENTS; PORPOISES; METALS; CONTAMINANTS; RESPONSES	The harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) from Helgoland (North Sea) and Anholt (Kattegat, Baltic Sea) are top predators within the marine food web and an indicator species of the environmental contamination. Furthermore, they are a main tourist attraction. Despite these important roles, little is known about the health and pollutant contamination of these seals. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate 18 essential and nonessential/toxic elements (Al, As, Be, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, Se, Sr, and Zn) in blood samples using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and total X-ray-fluorescence spectrometry. Blood concentrations of mineral nutrients, such as Ca, K, P, and S, were within the reference ranges described for harbor seals. Likewise, for the trace elements, As, Be, Rb, Se, and Sr, no significant differences were observed compared with previous studies. Interestingly, blood concentrations of nine nonessential as well as essential trace metals (Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Zn) measured significantly lower in the offshore living seals from Helgoland and Anholt compared with results obtained from animals living close to urbanized areas, such as the Wadden Sea and Elbe estuary. This suggests that industrial emissions, sewage deposition, shipping traffic and dredging tasks might be the cause of increased metal concentrations of inshore harbor seals.

J	Ruiz, DJ; Banks, S; Wolff, M				Ruiz, Diego J.; Banks, Stuart; Wolff, Matthias			Elucidating fishing effects in a large-predator dominated system: The case of Darwin and Wolf Islands (Galapagos)	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH			English	Article						Trophic modelling; Darwin; Wolf; Galapagos; Ecopath with Ecosim; Oceanic islands	SCALLOPED HAMMERHEAD SHARK; KENYAN CORAL-REEF; TROPHIC MODEL; SPHYRNA-LEWINI; ROCKY REEF; NORTHERN; COMMUNITIES; POPULATIONS; ECOSYSTEM; BIOMASS	Fifty years of artisanal fishing history in Galapagos characterized by boom and bust of resources has changed the natural marine community structure close to fishing ports in the Galapagos Marine Reserve. Nonetheless, the remote Darwin and Wolf Islands are still in a "near natural state" harboring high species richness unique for the archipelago and high biomass. Marine life that aggregates to the pinnacles linked to the wider oceanic seascape makes them interesting and unique systems in terms of community structure and study of on-shore/offshore trophic interactions. Although >200 km from local fishing ports the two islands also support an artisanal fishery targeting large demersal predators of high trophic levels. They are areas prioritized for conservation actions by Galapagos National Park, and local non-governmental organizations given their natural heritage importance, value to local fishers and revenue from dive tourism attracted by the promise of large marine predator aggregations such as sharks. Given that catch data upon which to base conservation recommendations is sparse it is difficult to accurately estimate present day fishing trends in Darwin and Wolf. We used atrophic steady-state model that connects benthic and pelagic communities to assess the potential effects of a change in fishing intensity in the two islands system. A predator-prey matrix was built using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software with total biomass estimated at 937 t km(-2). Large fish aggregations accounted for 19%, primary producers for 9.0% and non-fish (seabirds, marine mammals and sea turtles) for less than 0.1% of the total living biomass. The total system size in terms of overall flows was 16,652 t km(-2) year(-1), four times larger than a generic seamount model but smaller than that modeled for a Galapagos upwelling system based upon the western Bolivar Channel region. Consumption and respiration dominated the flows in the system (53.4 and 31.8% respectively). The Darwin and Wolf system shows a mature state, dominated by respiration, and top-down control via sharks and benthic predatory fish as the most important system compartments in terms of biomass. Model simulations suggest that heavy fishing pressure on top predators would greatly change the system's trophic structure. The nature of impacts depended on the types of gears simulated. Reduced natural predator densities through fishing exert strong direct and indirect influences on the system towards sea urchin-dominated benthos. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The structure of the biological community in MEARBs are poorly studied and it is though that a better understanding of this framework is key to sustainability. Here we present a food web model to characterize the benthic community and key functional groups in the MEABR of San Vicente Bay (36 degrees 44'S-73 degrees 09'W), using the Ecopath with Ecosim software (EwE). The Chilean albalone Concholepas concholepas is the main fishing resource in many MEABRs, including the MEABR of San Vicente Bay. The structuring role of main predators is assessed and compared using mixed trophic impacts (MTI) analysis and through calculate an interaction strength (IS) index. The results show that the main flows of consumption in the benthic community of the MEABR of San Vicente Bay occur in lower trophic levels (TL <= 2), while flows in higher trophic levels (TL <= 3) are related mainly to C. concholepas. The MTI and IS analysis show that C concholepas and crabs are the groups whose changes in biomass caused the greatest change in total system biomass in MEABR of San Vicente Bay and can be characterized as playing important ecological roles in that places. Exploitation resulted in direct and indirect trophic impacts that have the potential of affecting the sustainability of this and other MEABRs. Future research should also aim at advancing knowledge on basic ecological parameters of exploited benthic communities beyond target species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cephalopod species in the diet of large pelagic fish (sharks and billfishes) in Ecuadorian waters	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Ecuadorian waters; Billfishes; Sharks; Cephalopods; Dosidicus gigas; Trophic ecology	SQUID DOSIDICUS-GIGAS; SAILFISH ISTIOPHORUS-PLATYPTERUS; GULF-OF-CALIFORNIA; JUMBO SQUID; XIPHIAS-GLADIUS; THRESHER SHARK; FOOD-HABITS; ALOPIAS-SUPERCILIOSUS; SCALLOPED HAMMERHEAD; ISURUS-OXYRINCHUS	Large pelagic fish species are apex predators in the ecosystem of the Pacific Ocean, and they represent important economic resources for fisheries. In Ecuador there is a fishery for billfish such as Istophorus platypterus, Xiphias gladius, Makaira nigricans, and Kajikia audax, in which sharks such as Prionace glauca and Isurus oxyrinchus are also caught. Their prey includes small fish and cephalopods. We studied the trophic ecology of sharks and billfish captured in Santa Rosa (Salinas) and Playita Mia (Manta) Ecuador during 2013 and 2014, in order to evaluate their trophic relationship with different cephalopod species. Our results show that cephalopods are the most important prey in the diet of sharks (%IRI = 61.6) and billfishes (%IRI = 77.5). Twenty two species of cephalopods of the Orders Octopoda, Vampyromorphida and Teuthida were identified in the stomach contents, with Dosidicus gigas, Ancistrocheirus lesueurii and Histioteuthis dofleini being the most important. We also demonstrated that squid are abundant in waters off Ecuador. The ommastrephid D. gigas was the main prey for billfish (%IRI = 93.7 for X. gladius) and the second most important for sharks (%IRI = 44.9 for I. oxyrinchus). Cephalopods are key prey items for predatory pelagic fish in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Ecuador. Further studies on the diet of these fish species are needed to better understand their role as top-level predators in the marine food web and to improve knowledge of the diversity of cephalopods in the region.

In the present study, body feathers of > 200 wandering albatrosses from Possession Island in the Crozet archipelago were used to explore the potential demographic effects of the long-term exposure to Hg on an apex predator. Variations of Hg with sex, age class, foraging habitat (inferred from delta C-13 values), and feeding habits (inferred from delta N-15 values) were examined as well as the influence of Hg on current breeding output, long-term fecundity and survival. Wandering albatrosses displayed among the highest Hg feather concentrations reported for seabirds, ranging from 5.9 to 95 mu g g(-1), as a consequence of their high trophic position (delta N-15 values). These concentrations fall within the same range of those of other wandering albatross populations from subantarctic sites, suggesting that this species has similar exposure to Hg all around the Southern Ocean. In both immature and adult albatrosses, females had higher Hg concentrations than males (28 vs. 20 mu g g(-1) dw on average, respectively), probably as a consequence of females foraging at lower latitudes than males (delta C-13 values). Hg concentrations were higher in immature than in adult birds, and they remained fairly constant across a wide range of ages in adults. Such high levels in immature individuals question (i) the frequency of moult in young birds, (ii) the efficiency of Hg detoxification processes in immatures compared to adults, and (iii) importantly the potential detrimental effects of Hg in early life. Despite very high Hg concentrations in their feathers, neither effects on adults' breeding probability, hatching failure and fledgling failure, nor on adults' survival rate were detected, suggesting that long-term bioaccumulated Hg was not under a chemical form leading to deleterious effects on reproductive parameters in adult individuals.

Moreover, physical conditions and oxidative stress during development may reduce telomere lengths, one of the main mechanisms explaining cell senescence. To examine the potential effects of environmental contaminants on physiological biomarkers of health, OHCs with different 'physicochemical' properties were related to immunoglobulin Y levels (IgY; humoral immunity), superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity in blood plasma, and telomere length (measured in red blood cells) in individual 7-8 weeks old nestlings (n = 35) of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Norwegian Sub-Arctic. Different organochlorines (OCs) and perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) were measured in blood plasma of nestlings, demonstrating higher concentrations of the emerging contaminants (PFASs), notably perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compared to legacy OCs. There were no relationships between the contaminant loads and plasma IgY levels. Moreover, differences between years were found for telomere lengths, but this was not related to contaminants and more likely a result of different developmental conditions. However, there were significant and negative relationships between the OC loadings and the SOD activity. This suggests that some legacy OCs challenge the antioxidant capacity in nestlings of white-tailed eagles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although recently tracking observations have substantially increased, factors determining the horizontal exploration of the ocean by marine predators are still largely unknown, especially at the scale of behavioral switches (1-100 km, days-weeks). It is commonly assumed that the influence of water movement can be neglected for animals capable of swimming faster than the current. Here, we challenge this assumption by combining the use of biologging (GPS and accelerometry), satellite altimetry and in-situ oceanographic data (ADCP and drifting buoys) to investigate the effect of the mesoscale ocean dynamics on a marine predator, the southern elephant seal. A Lagrangian approach reveals that trajectories of elephant seals are characterized by quasi-planktonic bouts where the animals are horizontally drifting. These bouts correspond to periods of increased foraging effort, indicating that in the quasi-planktonic conditions energy is allocated to diving and chasing, rather than in horizontal search of favourable grounds. These results suggest that mesoscale features like eddies and fronts may act as a focal points for trophic interactions not only by bottom-up modulation of nutrient injection, but also by directly entraining horizontal displacements of the upper trophic levels.

Multi-species generalist predation on the stochastic harvested clam Tivela mactroides (Mollusca, Bivalvia)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						clam; diet; trophic ecology; predation	BOTTOM-UP INFLUENCES; TOP-DOWN; TRACHINOTUS-CAROLINUS; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; CARAGUATATUBA BAY; SPATIAL SCALES; SANDY BEACHES; LIFE-HISTORY; VENERIDAE	Top-down control is an important force modulating the abundance of prey and structuring marine communities. The harvested trigonal clam Tivela mactroides is hypothesized to be part of the diet of a variety of marine organisms, with its stock influencing predator abundance and being influenced by them. Here we analyzed the diet of potential predators of T. mactroides in Caraguatatuba Bay, northern coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, to identify the main consumers of this marine resource, and also to address the importance of this clam in the diet of each predator. Samples were taken year-round by trawls; all specimens collected were identified and measured and the food items identified and quantified. Twenty-one species consumed T mactroides, whose importance in the diet varied greatly in both the volume ingested and the frequency of occurrence (pompano Trachinotus carolinus > blue crab Callinectes danae > starfish Astropecten marginatus). Top-down influence on T. mactroides was also dependent on the abundance of consumers (yellow catfish Cathorops spixii > rake stardrum Stellifer rastrifer > barred grunt Conodon nobilis > A. marginatus). Considering the mean volume ingested, the frequency of occurrence of T mactroides in the diet, and the relative abundance of consumers, the predators that most influenced T. mactroides were T. carolinus, A. marginatus, and C. danae, in decreasing order. Large numbers of small-sized individuals of T. mactroides (<10 mm) were generally preyed upon by A. marginatus, which may have a stronger effect on clam abundance in comparison to C. danae and T. carolinus, which preyed upon larger clams. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that predators' consumption of T. mactroides in Caraguatatuba Bay can influence its stocks, mainly due to the type and/or abundance of predator species, the volume and number of individuals of T. mactroides preyed upon, and the temporal variations in the abundance of predators.

Can we increase our confidence about the locations of biodiversity 'hotspots' by using multiple diversity indices?	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						functional diversity; groundfish; marine spatial planning; species density; species evenness; taxonomic distinctness	MARINE BIODIVERSITY; TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; PREDATOR DIVERSITY; CONTINENTAL-SLOPE; SPECIES RICHNESS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; COUNT DATA; CONSERVATION	Some have suggested that targeting conservation efforts on biodiversity hotspots-areas of exceptionally high diversity-is the most efficient way to use limited resources to protect the most or rarest species. Moreover, the preservation of biodiversity is a focus for resource management and conservation because of the links between biodiversity and ecosystem function. However, there are many ways to define biodiversity and a plethora of diversity indices. Do these indices agree on where biodiversity hotspots are, and by extension, where conservation should take place? Here we use a habitat modeling approach to map spatial and temporal patterns in five community metrics of the demersal fish community in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem: species density, species evenness, taxonomic distinctness, functional divergence and total biomass. Depth, bottom temperature, sediment grain size, and distance to hard substratum were included as covariates in the model. All indices showed strong spatial patterns and relationships with depth. Spatial patterns for functional divergence and total biomass varied among years, but other indices did not show temporal variation. We identified hotspots as cells where at least one index was in the top 5% or 10% of its range. There was minimal spatial overlap among 10% hotspots for the five indices. Over 40% of the study area was classified as a biodiversity hotspot by at least one metric. However, no area was identified as a hotspot by all five metrics, and only slightly more than one percent of the coast was identified as within a hotspot for three or more metrics. Since different indices represent various aspects of diversity, our results caution against the uninformed use of these indices in the identification of biodiversity hotspots. Instead, we must define our objectives and then choose the relevant metrics for the problem.	[Tolimieri, N.; Shelton, A. O.; Feist, B.

Fish-derived nutrient hotspots shape coral reef benthic communities	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						biogeochemical hotspots; bottom-up; coral reefs; coral restoration; grunt fish; nutrient cycling; nutrient hotspots; nutrients; subsidies; top-down	SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SEAGRASS MEADOWS; ECOSYSTEMS; MARINE; RESILIENCE; TERRESTRIAL; CONSUMERS; NITROGEN; DISTRIBUTIONS; THRESHOLDS	Animal-derived nutrients play an important role in structuring nutrient regimes Within and between ecosystems. When animals undergo repetitive, aggregating behavior through time, they can create nutrient hotspots where rates of biogeochemical activity are higher than those found in the surrounding environment. In turn, these hotspots can influence ecosystem processes and community structure. We examined the potential for reef fishes from the family Haemulidae (grunts) to create nutrient hotspots and the potential impact of these hotspots on reef communities. To do so, we tracked the schooling locations of diurnally migrating grunts, which shelter at reef sites during the day but forage off reef each night, and measured the impact of these fish schools on benthic communities. We found that grunt schools showed a high degree of site fidelity, repeatedly returning to the same coral heads. These aggregations created nutrient hotspots around coral heads where nitrogen and phosphorus delivery was roughly 10 and 7 times the respective rates of delivery to structurally similar sites that lacked schools of these fishes. In turn, grazing rates of herbivorous fishes at grunt-derived hotspots were approximately 3 times those of sites where grunts were rare. These differences in nutrient delivery and grazing led to distinct benthic communities with higher cover of crustose coralline algae and less total algal abundance at grunt aggregation sites. Importantly, coral growth was roughly 1.5 times greater at grunt hotspots, likely due to the important nutrient subsidy. Our results suggest that schooling reef fish and their nutrient subsidies play an important role in mediating community structure on coral reefs and that overfishing may have important negative consequences on ecosystem functions. As such, management strategies must consider mesopredatory fishes in addition to current protection often offered to herbivores and top-tier predators. Furthermore, our results suggest that restoration strategies may benefit from focusing on providing structure for aggregating fishes on reefs with low topographic complexity or focusing the restoration of nursery raised corals around existing nutrient hotspots.

Such buoyancy changes can be monitored by measuring changes in the rate at which a seal drifts passively through the water column, i.e. when all active swimming motion ceases. Here, we present an improved knowledge-based method for detecting buoyancy changes from compressed and abstracted dive profiles received through telemetry. By step-wise filtering of the dive data, the developed algorithm identifies fragments of dives that correspond to times when animals drift. In the dive records of 11 southern elephant seals from South Georgia, this filtering method identified 0.8-2.2% of all dives as drift dives, indicating large individual variation in drift diving behaviour. The obtained drift rate time series exhibit that, at the beginning of each migration, all individuals were strongly negatively buoyant. Over the following 75-150 days, the buoyancy of all individuals peaked close to or at neutral buoyancy, indicative of a seal's foraging success. Independent verification with visually inspected detailed high-resolution dive data confirmed that this method is capable of reliably detecting buoyancy changes in the dive records of drift diving species using abstracted data. This also affirms that abstracted dive profiles convey the geometric shape of drift dives in sufficient detail for them to be identified. Further, it suggests that, using this step-wise filtering method, buoyancy changes could be detected even in old datasets with compressed dive information, for which conventional drift dive classification previously failed.

Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) show genetic and morphological divergence between the western and central archipelago, possibly as a result of an ecologically mediated contrast in the marine habitat. We use global positioning system (GPS) data, time-depth recordings (TDR), stable isotope and scat data to compare foraging habitat characteristics, diving behaviour and diet composition of Galapagos sea lions from a western and a central colony. We consider both juvenile and adult life stages to assess the potential role of ontogenetic shifts that can be crucial in shaping foraging behaviour and habitat choice for life. We found differences in foraging habitat use, foraging style and diet composition that aligned with genetic differentiation. These differences were consistent between juvenile and adult sea lions from the same colony, overriding age-specific behavioural differences. Our study contributes to an understanding of the complex interaction of ecological condition, plastic behavioural response and genetic make-up of interconnected populations.	[Jeglinski, Jana W.

J	Peltier, H; Ridoux, V				Peltier, Helene; Ridoux, Vincent			Marine megavertebrates adrift: A framework for the interpretation of stranding data in perspective of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive and other regional agreements	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Top predators; Conservation strategies; Monitoring; Strandings; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Indicators	BEACHED BIRD SURVEYS; VALDEZ OIL-SPILL; BOTTLE-NOSED-DOLPHIN; SEA-TURTLE; DELPHINUS-DELPHIS; PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; HARBOR PORPOISES; NULL HYPOTHESES; FEEDING ECOLOGY; BYCATCH	For many species of marine megafauna, strandings remain the most important source of biological samples. Because of their opportunistic nature however, strandings data have long been under- or misused in the assessment of population conservation status. Even if many national and international regulations promote the use of strandings in monitoring strategies, the interpretation of strandings remains controversial. The aim of this study is to provide a context for the interpretation of marine megafauna stranding data, in order to assess the achievement of specific objectives against Good Environmental Status criteria in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive or other regional agreements. The first step is to construct an a priori spatial distribution under a null hypothesis HO. The a priori spatial distribution of theoretical dead animals can either be set uniformly, consistent with current knowledge on abundance of marine vertebrates, or based on management objectives. The drift prediction of these theoretical carcasses would provide a time series of strandings expected under the null hypothesis. The reverse drift of observed strandings would highlight mortality areas of stranded animals. The correction of these areas by the probability of getting stranded according to drift conditions would provide an estimated distribution of dead animals inferred from strandings. The differences between expected and observed situations constitute anomalies and highlight cases where inferred distribution departs from the a priori spatial distribution. This work proposes several population indicators that can be used anywhere in the world and can be applied for all large marine vertebrates found stranded. The integration of these indicators in MSFD and various regional agreements could provide cost-effective and relevant information on protected species. In the context of impaired ecological situations, the complementary use of several population indicators could strengthen the diagnosis made regarding conservation status and hence conservation strategies.

Shell ornamentation as a likely exaptation: evidence from predatory drilling on Cenozoic bivalves	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							EOCENE MOLLUSCAN ASSEMBLAGE; FOSSIL RECORD; NATICID GASTROPODS; CORBULID BIVALVES; CONCHIOLIN SHEETS; HOLE PREDATION; PREY SYSTEM; SPINES; BRACHIOPOD; INTENSITY	Predation is an important process in modern oceans and in the evolutionary history of marine ecosystems. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that shelled prey modified their ornamentation in response to predation. However, bivalve ornamentation has also been argued to be important in maintaining a stable life position in the sediment and in burrowing. To test whether concentric ribs were effective against drilling by carnivorous gastropods, we examined drill hole position and completeness for four Cenozoic bivalve species that differ in rib strength (Astarte radiata, A. goldfussi, Lirophora glyptocyma, and L. latilirata). The percentage of drill holes located between the ribs increases with increasing rib strength, whereas the percentage of drill holes on top of ribs decreases. This result suggests that gastropods select the drill hole site more effectively as rib strength increases, thereby saving time and energy, and that natural selection favors gastropods that select drill hole sites between ribs. Because of this greater stereotypy, the percentage of drill holes that are incomplete is generally lower in strongly ribbed species. The proportion of drill holes located on top of ribs is greater for incomplete than complete holes, implying that ribs can be effective against predators, but only when selected as the drilling location. We show that ribs are most effective against drilling predation for bivalves with moderately sized ribs, between which gastropods have difficulty siting drill holes. Concentric ribs are unlikely to have evolved as an adaptation against drilling predation because concentric ribs evolved in the Paleozoic and were already common in the Mesozoic, whereas drilling frequency increased later, in the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene. Moreover, rib strength of North American Astarte did not change through this time interval. Thus, the ribs considered here are a likely exaptation to drilling given their effectiveness at deterring drilling predation on bivalves with moderate ribs.

Squidpops: A Simple Tool to Crowdsource a Global Map of Marine Predation Intensity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CORAL-REEF; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; GRAZING INTENSITY; PRIMARY PRODUCERS; PRODUCTIVITY; TERRESTRIAL; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; FISH; ECOSYSTEMS	We present a simple, standardized assay, the squidpop, for measuring the relative feeding intensity of generalist predators in aquatic systems. The assay consists of a 1.3-cm diameter disk of dried squid mantle tethered to a rod, which is either inserted in the sediment in soft-bottom habitats or secured to existing structure. Each replicate squidpop is scored as present or absent after 1 and 24 hours, and the data for analysis are proportions of replicate units consumed at each time. Tests in several habitats of the temperate southeastern USA (Virginia and North Carolina) and tropical Central America (Belize) confirmed the assay's utility for measuring variation in predation intensity among habitats, among seasons, and along environmental gradients. In Belize, predation intensity varied strongly among habitats, with reef > seagrass = mangrove > unvegetated bare sand. Quantitative visual surveys confirmed that assayed feeding intensity increased with abundance and species richness of fishes across sites, with fish abundance and richness explaining up to 45% and 70% of the variation in bait loss respectively. In the southeastern USA, predation intensity varied seasonally, being highest during summer and declining in late autumn. Deployments in marsh habitats generally revealed a decline in mean predation intensity from fully marine to tidal freshwater sites. The simplicity, economy, and standardization of the squidpop assay should facilitate engagement of scientists and citizens alike, with the goal of constructing high-resolution maps of how top-down control varies through space and time in aquatic ecosystems, and addressing a broad array of long-standing hypotheses in macro-and community ecology.

While marine top predators are increasingly easy to study thanks to developments in bio-logging technology, typically there is scant information on the distribution and abundance of their prey, largely due to the specialised nature of acquiring this information. We explore the potential of using single-beam recreational fish-finders (RFF) to quantify relative forage fish abundance and draw inferences of the prey distribution at a fine spatial scale. We compared fish school characteristics as inferred from the RFF with that of a calibrated scientific split-beam echo-sounder (SES) by simultaneously operating both systems from the same vessel in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Customized open-source software was developed to extract fish school information from the echo returns of the RFF. For schools insonified by both systems, there was close correspondence between estimates of mean school depth (R-2 = 0.98) and school area (R-2 = 0.70). Estimates of relative school density (mean volume backscattering strength; S-v) measured by the RFF were negatively biased through saturation of this system given its smaller dynamic range. A correction factor applied to the RFF-derived density estimates improved the comparability between the two systems. Relative abundance estimates using all schools from both systems were congruent at scales from 0.5 km to 18 km with a strong positive linear trend in model fit estimates with increasing scale. Although absolute estimates of fish abundance cannot be derived from these systems, they are effective at describing prey school characteristics and have good potential for mapping forage fish distribution and relative abundance. Using such relatively inexpensive systems could greatly enhance our understanding of predator-prey interactions.

Deep-ocean foraging northern elephant seals bioaccumulate persistent organic pollutants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Pinniped; Ecotoxicology; Blubber burden; Foraging ecology; Mesopelagic; Contaminants	LIONS ZALOPHUS-CALIFORNIANUS; POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL EXPOSURE; POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; PRINCE-WILLIAM-SOUND; MIROUNGA-ANGUSTIROSTRIS; HARBOR SEALS; ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS; EUMETOPIAS-JUBATUS; TEMPORAL TRENDS; MARINE MAMMALS	As top predators in the northeast Pacific Ocean, northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are vulnerable to bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Our study examined a suite of POPs in blubber (inner and outer) and blood (serum) of free-ranging northern elephant seals. For adult females (N=24), we satellite tracked and sampled the same seals before and after their approximately seven month long foraging trip. For males, we sampled different adults and sub-adults before (N=14) and after (N=15) the same foraging trip. For females, we calculated blubber burdens for all compounds. The highest POP concentrations in males and females were found for Sigma DDTs and Sigma PCBs. In blubber and serum, males had significantly greater concentrations than females for almost all compounds. For males and females, Sigma DDT and Sigma PBDEs were highly correlated in blubber and serum. While Sigma PCBs were highly correlated with Sigma DDTs and Sigma PBDEs in blubber and serum for males, Sigma PCBs showed weaker correlations with both compounds in females. As females gained mass while foraging, concentrations of nearly all POPs in inner and outer blubber significantly decreased; however, the absolute burden in blubber significantly increased, indicating ingestion of contaminants while foraging. Additionally, we identified three clusters of seal foraging behavior, based on geography, diving behavior, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, which corresponded with differences in Sigma DDTs, Sigma PBDEs, MeO-BDE 47, as well as the ratio of Sigma DDTs to Sigma PCBs, indicating the potential for behavior to heighten or mitigate contaminant exposure. The greatest concentrations of Sigma DDTs and Sigma PBDEs were observed in the cluster that foraged closer to the coast and had blood samples more enriched in C-13. Bioaccumulation of POPs by elephant seals supports mesopelagic food webs as a sink for POPs and highlights elephant seals as a potential sentinel of contamination in deep ocean food webs.

Marine environmental monitoring in the shelf zone of the Black Sea: Assessment of the current state of the pelagic ecosystem	OCEANOLOGY			English	Article								The state of the shelf pelagic ecosystem has been assessed based on multidisciplinary monitoring performed in the northeastern Black Sea in 2005-2014. Seasonal and interannual variations in sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration have been analyzed along with the concentration of nutrients (silicate, nitrogen, and phosphate), biomass, and taxonomic compositions of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and gelatinous macroplankton. The linear trend shows an increase in the annual average SST by 0.9A degrees C over the last decade. An increase in the winter SST is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of silicates in spring (p < 0.05) and an increase in summer SST, by a decrease in Chl-a concentration and biomass of diatoms in the period of summer to fall (p < 0.05). A decrease in the phosphate concentration also has a negative effect on the development of diatoms (p < 0.01). The decrease in diatom biomass caused a decrease in herbivorous zooplankton biomass in the second half of the year (p = 0.05). Correlation analysis shows no significant dependence between the biomass of gelatinous top predators and mesozooplankton biomass. The assessed current state of the shelf pelagic ecosystem is regarded as stable; however, trends of a decrease in biomass and a change in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton are observed during the last 2 years; the latter is likely to result from both direct and indirect effects of temperature increase in the upper sea layer.

Modeling food web structure and energetic control in Alaskan marine ecosystems, with implications for fishing and environmental forcing	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Review							EASTERN BERING-SEA; OSCILLATING CONTROL HYPOTHESIS; POLLOCK THERAGRA-CHALCOGRAMMA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH PACIFIC; COMMUNITY REORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; BOTTOM-UP; MANAGEMENT; GULF	The Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) continental shelf ecosystems show some similar and some distinctive groundfish biomass dynamics. Given that similar species occupy these regions and fisheries management is also comparable, similarities might be expected, but to what can we attribute the differences? Different types of ecosystem structure and control (e.g. top-down, bottom-up, mixed) can imply different ecosystem dynamics and climate interactions. Further, the structural type identified for a given ecosystem may suggest optimal management for sustainable fishing. Here, we use information on the current system state derived from food web models of both the EBS and the GOA combined with dynamic ecosystem models incorporating uncertainty to classify each ecosystem by its structural type. We then suggest how this structure might be generally related to dynamics and predictability. We find that the EBS and GOA have fundamentally different food web structures both overall, and when viewed from the perspective of the same commercially and ecologically important species in each system, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). EBS food web structure centers on a large mass of pollock, which appears to contribute to relative system stability and predictability. In contrast, GOA food web structure features high predator biomass, which contributes to a more dynamic, less predictable ecosystem. Mechanisms for climate influence on pollock production in the EBS are increasingly understood, while climate forcing mechanisms contributing to the potentially destabilizing high predator biomass in the GOA remain enigmatic. We present results of identical pollock fishing and climate-driven pollock recruitment simulations in the EBS and GOA which show different system responses, again with less predictable response in the GOA. Overall, our results suggest that identifying structural properties of fished food webs is as important for sustainable fisheries management as attempting to predict climate and fisheries effects within each ecosystem.

Association between whole blood mercury and glucose intolerance among adult Inuit in Greenland	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Glucose intolerance; Whole blood mercury; Inuit; Type 2 diabetes	MUSCLE INSULIN-RESISTANCE; MARINE FOOD; EXPOSURE; METHYLMERCURY; QUESTIONNAIRE; POPULATION; TOLERANCE; CADMIUM; LEAD	Objectives: The Arctic diet is partly constituted by traditional food characterized by top predator animals such as whales, walrus, and seals with high mercury content. Mercury exposure has been associated with glucose intolerance in Western populations. We studied the association between whole blood mercury and glucose intolerance in a highly exposed non-Western population Methods: Cross-sectional study of 2640 Inuit (18+ years) with information on ancestry, smoking, waist circumference, total energy intake, and physical activity. Mercury, fasting- and 2-h plasma glucose, insulin, and c-peptide were measured in blood. Fasting participants without diabetes were classified into normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glycemia, or type 2 diabetes. We calculated hepatic insulin resistance with homoeostatic model assessment - insulin resistance index, peripheral insulin sensitivity by ISI0,120, and relative beta cell function by c-peptide/insulin ratio. We conducted adjusted linear- and logistic regression analyses. Results: For an increase in whole blood mercury of 5 mu g/L we found a positive association with fasting glucose [% change=0.25 (95% CI: 0.20; 0.30); p < 0.001], and 2-h glucose [% change=0.23 (95% CI: 0.05; 0.40); p=0.01]. Mercury was weakly associated with impaired fasting glycemia [OR=1.03 (95% CI: 1.02; 1.05)], and type 2 diabetes [OR=1.02 (95% CI: 1.01; 1.04)]. Conclusion: While the study found a weak but statistically significant association between whole blood mercury and both impaired fasting glycemia and type 2 diabetes, no associations were found with measures of underlying disturbances in glucose homoeostasis.

Yet there is concern that we lack resolution by conducting experiments on a scale that is too small and short to include the relevant complexity of the study system. We addressed this issue by asking how and why the scale (local and global spatial extent, spatial grain, duration) and complexity (number of species, factors, treatment combinations) of experiments performed on marine hard substrata (rocky intertidal, RI; coral reef, CR; rocky subtidal, RS; mangrove root, MR) has changed by assessing 311 total experiments published since 1961 in Ecology and Ecological Monographs and since 1967 in Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. We show that the local spatial extent and all metrics of complexity increased as a positive, log-linear function of time. In contrast, the size of experimental units (spatial grain) decreased with time. Quantile regression analysis revealed that these trends are largely driven by changes in the upper bounds of experimental scale and complexity; most studies are still relatively simple in design and conducted over small areas. A structural equation model (SEM) incorporated the direct and indirect effects of six metrics indicating that the complexity of field experiments has increased both as a direct effect of time and because experiments have become smaller in spatial grain. The SEM also showed longer experiments tended to be more complex. We show striking habitat differences, as subtidal experiments (CR, RS) involved more species and were carried out on the largest global spatial scales. RI experiments were the longest. Future prospects to incorporate more of the complexity of nature into field experiments include site replication, as only 34.7% of all experiments were conducted at more than one site, open experimental designs monitored by technology, and integrating experimental manipulations with long-term monitoring to achieve mechanistic insight across scales relevant to human alteration of the biosphere. The increasing resolution of remote sensing also creates opportunities to track experiment-driven changes in community structure across large scales. We suggest applying these methods to a wider class of problems to enhance our understanding of marine communities and ecosystems.

This once-abundant sea has witnessed major declines in apex predators, now largely restricted to isolated pockets within marine reserves. This depletion could critically impact macrophyte communities that are strongly structured by top-down processes. We evaluated rates of predation on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a key herbivore of macroalgal and Posidonia oceanica seagrass seascapes, across a large stretch of the Western Mediterranean coastline. Fish predation was generally higher inside reserves, but was equally high at several locations outside these boundaries. Although critically low at some locations compared to reserves, predation was functionally ubiquitous in most habitats, seasons and sites. Fish were still primarily responsible for this predation with no clear evidence of meso-predator release. Macroalgal habitats were consistently subject to higher predation than in seagrass meadows, functionally critical given the vulnerability of macroalgal systems to overgrazing. Predation hotspots were clearly associated with high fish predator numbers and low refuge availability. Taken together, these results suggest that long-term overfishing may not necessarily reflect a complete loss of trophic function. Pockets of fish predation may still persist, linked to habitat complexity, predator behavioral adaptations and landscape-level features. Given the essential role top-down control plays in macroalgal communities, regulating fishing at these predation hotspots is vital to effectively conserve habitats from future hysteretic shifts. Even historically fished seas may retain areas where trophic function persists; identifying these areas is critical to preserving the remaining ecological integrity of these coastlines.

As ecosystems are simultaneously exposed to other anthropogenic influences, it is important to address the effects of climate change in the context of many stressors. Nutrient enrichment might offset some of the energy demands that warming can exert on organisms by stimulating growth at the base of the food web. It is important to know whether indirect effects of warming will be as ecologically significant as direct physiological effects. Declining body size is increasingly viewed as a universal response to warming, with the potential to alter trophic interactions. To address these issues, we used an outdoor array of marine mesocosms to examine the impacts of warming, nutrient enrichment and altered top-predator body size on a community comprised of the predator (shore crab Carcinus maenas), various grazing detritivores (amphipods) and algal resources. Warming increased mortality rates of crabs, but had no effect on their moulting rates. Nutrient enrichment and warming had near diametrically opposed effects on the assemblage, confirming that the ecological effects of these two stressors can cancel each other out. This suggests that nutrient-enriched systems might act as an energy refuge to populations of species under metabolic constraints due to warming. While there was a strong difference in assemblages between mesocosms containing crabs compared to mesocosms without crabs, decreasing crab size had no detectable effect on the amphipod or algal assemblages. This suggests that in allometrically balanced communities, the expected long-term effect of warming (declining body size) is not of similar ecological consequence to the direct physiological effects of warming, at least not over the six week duration of the experiment described here. More research is needed to determine the long-term effects of declining body size on the bioenergetic balance of natural communities.

Top-down control by great blue herons Ardea herodias regulates seagrass-associated epifauna	OIKOS			English	Article							INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; TROPHIC CASCADES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; FOOD WEBS; COMMUNITIES; PREDATORS; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; ECOSYSTEM	Top predators can influence the structure and function of plant and animal communities. In coastal marine systems, fish, shark and mammal population declines are major drivers of recent ecosystem-level change. Cascading effects of predatory wading birds, however, are less understood, even though wading bird populations have declined in many regions. We quantified the effects of predation by the piscivorous great blue heron Ardea herodias fannini on fish, invertebrates and epiphytes living in eelgrass Zostera marina. We found that herons forage on benthic fish in seagrass meadows, and foraging intensity increased from late spring until midsummer. When we experimentally excluded herons, benthic fish abundance increased, and the invertebrate assemblage shifted to more shrimp-dominated assemblages while grazing gammarid amphipod abundance declined. These shifts were associated with reduced epiphyte abundance when herons were excluded, reflecting a four-level trophic cascade and mediated by shifts in the grazer assemblage. In summary, we found that a piscivorous wading bird species exerts top down control in a subtidal seagrass ecosystem. Losses and recovery of wading birds could have ecosystem-level ecological consequences that may need to be considered in the context of concern for overfishing and predator recovery in marine coastal management.

However, these hypotheses do not consider the existence of parallel energy channels linked by shared resource pools and which can fuel generalist predators, imposing trophic control arising from multi-channel processes. Using 23 large marine food webs, we show that food web responses to increasing productivity are consistent with the apparent trophic cascade hypothesis (ATCH) - with rising productivity predators derive an increasing fraction of their diet from increasingly productive bottom-up controlled detritus channels, thereby subsidising predator biomass, and in turn strengthening top-down control in parallel grazing channels. These results testify to a fundamental role of detritus channels specifically and multi-channel processes in general in mediating food web response to productivity and demonstrate that the ATCH provides an alternative explanation for classical predictions of top-down control.

However, developing predictive models of habitat use is challenging for species that forage in marine environments, as both predators and prey are often highly mobile and difficult to monitor. Consequently, few studies have developed resource selection functions for marine predators based directly on the abundance and distribution of their prey. We analysed contemporaneous data on the diving locations of two seabird species, the shallow-diving Peruvian Booby (Sula variegata) and deeper diving Guanay Cormorant (Phalacrocorax bougainvilliorum), and the abundance and depth distribution of their main prey, Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens). Based on this unique data set, we developed resource selection functions to test the hypothesis that the probability of seabird diving behaviour at a given location is a function of the relative abundance of prey in the upper water column. For both species, we show that the probability of diving behaviour is mostly explained by the distribution of prey at shallow depths. While the probability of diving behaviour increases sharply with prey abundance at relatively low levels of abundance, support for including abundance in addition to the depth distribution of prey is weak, suggesting that prey abundance was not a major factor determining the location of diving behaviour during the study period. The study thus highlights the importance of the depth distribution of prey for two species of seabird with different diving capabilities. The results complement previous research that points towards the importance of oceanographic processes that enhance the accessibility of prey to seabirds. The implications are that locations where prey is predictably found at accessible depths may be more important for surface foragers, such as seabirds, than locations where prey is predictably abundant. Analysis of the relative importance of abundance and accessibility is essential for the design and evaluation of effective management responses to reduced prey availability for seabirds and other top predators in marine systems.

Primary productivity and species richness decrease poleward at mid and high latitudes in the Southwestern Atlantic, and hence food chain length of coastal ecosystems is expected to decrease poleward, unless seasonal changes in water temperature destabilise food webs at mid latitude. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen and SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R) to determine the food chain length and other patterns of interconnections (i.e. topology) of coastal food webs from 3 contrasting regions: the temperate estuarine zone associated with the Rio de la Plata plume, the tidal zone off northern and central Patagonia, and the cold estuarine zone off southern Patagonia. Results indicate that food chain length decreases and trophic redundancy increases as latitude increases in all of the compartments of the food web considered. This is in agreement with results emerging from reconstructions of marine food web length during the late Holocene in the same regions, thus suggesting that they are not artefacts caused by the intense exploitation of top predators in the region since European settlement. Furthermore, differences in primary productivity do not fully explain the observed patterns. Instead, we argue that the latitudinal reduction of species diversity reported for the Southwestern Atlantic may be the primary reason for the observed pattern. The reduction in the diversity of forage fishes and squids at high latitude is proposed to result into a wasp-waist ecosystem, characterised by a high trophic redundancy at high trophic levels.

Top predators rely on carbon derived from giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Ecosystem engineers; Stable isotopes; Trophic subsidy; Detritus; Grazing; Benthic	FOREST FOOD WEBS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; ECOSYSTEMS; COMMUNITIES; REEF; PLANT; CONSUMERS	Net primary production (NPP) fundamentally shapes ecosystems, but the fate of NPP and its transfer through the food web varies depending on its appeal and availability to consumers. Kelp forests are complex and diverse marine ecosystems, and kelp biomass and NPP can vary widely due to processes including trophic cascades and consequent changes in grazing pressure, storm wave disturbance, and changes in ocean climate and nutrients. Kelp, like other foundation species, clearly modulates the physical environment in which species interact: dense canopies of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera shade the reef, shaping the benthic community, and dampen flow through the forest. Yet little quantitative work has investigated the trophic contribution of kelps to kelp forest food webs. Here, we show that giant kelp provides significant trophic support to fishes living in the canopy of the kelp forest. Carbon contributions from kelp, via mesograzer prey, relative to pelagic carbon sources, increased with increasing trophic level of fishes, showing that giant kelp is particularly important to top predators. These findings suggest that losses of giant kelp would have significant consequences for coastal ecosystems and have important implications for the conservation and management of temperate reef ecosystems.

Reef Fishes at All Trophic Levels Respond Positively to Effective Marine Protected Areas	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CORAL-REEFS; SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; ASSEMBLAGES; DIVERSITY; RESERVE; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; ABUNDANCE	Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) offer a unique opportunity to test the assumption that fishing pressure affects some trophic groups more than others. Removal of larger predators through fishing is often suggested to have positive flow-on effects for some lower trophic groups, in which case protection from fishing should result in suppression of lower trophic groups as predator populations recover. We tested this by assessing differences in the trophic structure of reef fish communities associated with 79 MPAs and open-access sites worldwide, using a standardised quantitative dataset on reef fish community structure. The biomass of all major trophic groups (higher carnivores, benthic carnivores, planktivores and herbivores) was significantly greater (by 40% - 200%) in effective no-take MPAs relative to fished open-access areas. This effect was most pronounced for individuals in large size classes, but with no size class of any trophic group showing signs of depressed biomass in MPAs, as predicted from higher predator abundance. Thus, greater biomass in effective MPAs implies that exploitation on shallow rocky and coral reefs negatively affects biomass of all fish trophic groups and size classes. These direct effects of fishing on trophic structure appear stronger than any top down effects on lower trophic levels that would be imposed by intact predator populations. We propose that exploitation affects fish assemblages at all trophic levels, and that local ecosystem function is generally modified by fishing.

Aerial surveys are a common tool to monitor the density and abundance of marine mammals, and have recently become a focus in the search for methods to provide fisheries-independent abundance indicators for tuna stock assessment. In this study, we present first density estimates corrected for availability bias of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) from the Golf of Lions (GoL), compared with uncorrected estimates of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT; Thunnus thynnus) densities from 8 years of line transect aerial surveys. The raw sighting data were further used to analyze patterns of spatial co-occurrence and density of these three top marine predators in this important feeding ground in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. These patterns were investigated regarding known species-specific feeding preferences and environmental characteristics (i. e. mesoscale activity) of the survey zone. ABFT was by far the most abundant species during the surveys in terms of schools and individuals, followed by striped dolphins and fin whales. However, when accounted for availability bias, schools of dolphins and fin whales were of equal density. Direct interactions of the species appeared to be the exception, but results indicate that densities, presence and core sighting locations of striped dolphins and ABFT were correlated. Core sighting areas of these species were located close to an area of high mesoscale activity (oceanic fronts and eddies). Fin whales did not show such a correlation. The results further highlight the feasibility to coordinate research efforts to explore the behaviour and abundance of the investigated species, as demanded by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).

Combined Use of GPS and Accelerometry Reveals Fine Scale Three-Dimensional Foraging Behaviour in the Short-Tailed Shearwater	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CALIFORNIA CURRENT SYSTEM; GANNETS MORUS-BASSANUS; WANDERING ALBATROSSES; PUFFINUS-TENUIROSTRIS; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; SATELLITE TRACKING; NORTHERN GANNETS; ACTIVITY PATTERN; DIVING DEPTHS; TOP PREDATOR	Determining the foraging behaviour of free-ranging marine animals is fundamental for assessing their habitat use and how they may respond to changes in the environment. However, despite recent advances in bio-logging technology, collecting information on both at-sea movement patterns and activity budgets still remains difficult in small pelagic seabird species due to the constraints of instrument size. The short-tailed shearwater, the most abundant seabird species in Australia (ca 23 million individuals), is a highly pelagic procellariiform. Despite its ecological importance to the region, almost nothing is known about its at-sea behaviour, in particular, its foraging activity. Using a combination of GPS and tri-axial accelerometer data-loggers, the fine scale three-dimensional foraging behaviour of 10 breeding individuals from two colonies was investigated. Five at-sea behaviours were identified: (1) resting on water, (2) flapping flight, (3) gliding flight, (4) foraging (i.e., surface foraging and diving events), and (5) taking-off. There were substantial intra-and inter-individual variations in activity patterns, with individuals spending on average 45.8% (range: 17.1-70.0%) of time at sea resting on water and 18.2%(range: 2.3-49.6%) foraging. Individuals made 76.4 +/- 65.3 dives (range: 8-237) per foraging trip (mean duration 9.0 +/- 1.9 s), with dives also recorded during night-time. With the continued miniaturisation of recording devices, the use of combined data-loggers could provide us with further insights into the foraging behaviour of small procellariiforms, helping to better understand interactions with their prey.

A field experiment on trophic relations within the benthic boundary layer (BBL) over an oligotrophic continental shelf	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Benthic boundary layer; Hyperbenthos; Marine fish; Food availability; Prey selection; Eastern Mediterranean	PANDORA PAGELLUS-ERYTHRINUS; SOUTH AEGEAN SEA; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FEEDING-HABITS; CRETAN SEA; DEMERSAL FISHES; HERAKLION BAY; PATTERNS; BOTTOM; DIET	The benthic boundary layer (BBL) macrofauna consists of epibenthic, hyperbenthic and zooplanktonic organisms with different degrees of mobility and bottom dependence. The top-level predators within this habitat include demersal fish species. The BBL species are considered to be the most readily available prey for these fish making them an attractive source of food and therefore key taxa in marine food webs. The present study is a field experiment in the oligotrophic continental shelf of Heraklion Bay (Cretan Sea, eastern Mediterranean) investigating the ways in which demersal fish utilize BBL sources as food. Species diversity patterns derived from samples collected by using a modified hyperbenthic sledge as well as different benthic, hyperbenthic and pelagic samplers are described. These patterns are compared with those derived from stomach content analysis of demersal fish species inhabiting the same area. Results reveal that BBL macrofaunal communities which comprise most of the available prey communities are largely exploited by demersal fish species. Furthermore, the application of different samplers provides complementary information on prey selectivity of macrofaunal organisms by demersal fish species, highlighting further the trophic interactions within the BBL habitat.

The Foraging Ecology of the Endangered Cape Verde Shearwater, a Sentinel Species for Marine Conservation off West Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AREA-RESTRICTED SEARCH; TRANS-EQUATORIAL MIGRATION; CORYS SHEARWATERS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; PELAGIC SEABIRD; ROUND DISTRIBUTION; 1ST-PASSAGE TIME; NORTHWEST AFRICA; MAXIMUM-ENTROPY; HABITAT USE	Large Marine Ecosystems such as the Canary Current system off West Africa sustains high abundance of small pelagic prey, which attracts marine predators. Seabirds are top predators often used as biodiversity surrogates and sentinel species of the marine ecosystem health, thus frequently informing marine conservation planning. This study presents the first data on the spatial (GPS-loggers) and trophic (stable isotope analysis) ecology of a tropical seabird-the endangered Cape Verde shearwater Calonectris edwardsii-during both the incubation and the chick-rearing periods of two consecutive years. This information was related with marine environmental predictors (species distribution models), existent areas of conservation concern for seabirds (i.e. marine Important Bird Areas; marine IBAs) and threats to the marine environment in the West African areas heavily used by the shearwaters. There was an apparent inter-annual consistency on the spatial, foraging and trophic ecology of Cape Verde shearwater, but a strong alteration on the foraging strategies of adult breeders among breeding phases (i.e. from incubation to chick-rearing). During incubation, birds mostly targeted a discrete region off West Africa, known by its enhanced productivity profile and thus also highly exploited by international industrial fishery fleets. When chick-rearing, adults exploited the comparatively less productive tropical environment within the islands of Cape Verde, at relatively close distance from their breeding colony. The species enlarged its trophic niche and increased the trophic level of their prey from incubation to chick-rearing, likely to provision their chicks with a more diversified and better quality diet. There was a high overlap between the Cape Verde shearwaters foraging areas with those of European shearwater species that overwinter in this area and known areas of megafauna bycatch off West Africa, but very little overlap with existing Marine Important Bird Areas. Further investigation on the potential nefarious effects of fisheries on seabird communities exploiting the Canary Current system off West Africa is needed. Such negative effects could be alleviated or even dissipated if the 'fisheries-conservation hotspots' identified for the region, would be legislated as Marine Protected Areas.

The high exploitation rates inferred by the authors are alarming and, if accurate, justify the increased concern of the global conservation community. To assess the generality and accuracy of this work, I critically evaluate the assumptions and validity of the extrapolations made by the authors. This global study provided a valuable overall perspective on the highly relevant topic of shark conservation; however, the generalizations made carry substantial uncertainty that was not accounted for. My review aims to place the conclusions drawn by the authors into perspective, highlighting numerous factors that, having been considered, would have significantly affected their claims.

A switch in the Atlantic Oscillation correlates with inter-annual changes in foraging location and food habits of Macaronesian shearwaters (Puffinus baroli) nesting on two islands of the sub-tropical Atlantic Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS			English	Article						Isotopic niche; Niche overlap; Niche width; SIBER Environmental variation; Macaronesian shearwater	STABLE-ISOTOPE SIGNATURES; NORTH-ATLANTIC; CORYS SHEARWATERS; SEXUAL SEGREGATION; DELTA-N-15 VALUES; TROPHIC ECOLOGY; FEEDING ECOLOGY; CANARY-ISLANDS; AVIAN BLOOD; NICHE WIDTH	Changes in oceanographic conditions, shaped by changes in large-scale atmospheric phenomena such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), alters the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. Such signals are readily captured by marine top predators, given that their use of foraging habitats and diets change when the NAO changes. In this study we assessed sexual, seasonal and annual (2010/11-2012/13) differences in diet, trophic and isotopic niche (using delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of whole blood, 1st primary, 8th secondary and breast feathers), foraging locations and oceanographic variation within foraging areas for Macaronesian shearwaters' (Puffinus baroli) during two years of contrasting NAO values, and between two sub-tropical islands 330 km apart in the North Atlantic Ocean, Cima Islet and Selvagem Grande. These two locations provide contrasting oceanographic foraging regimes for the birds, because the second colony is much closer to the African coast (375 vs 650 km), and, therefore, to the upwelling area of the Canary Current. There was a marked environmental perturbation in 2010/2011, related with a negative NAO Index and lower marine productivity (lower concentration of Chlorophyll a). This event corresponded to the Macaronesian shearwaters feeding farther north and west, which was readily seen in change of both delta N-15 and delta C-13 values, and in a higher intake of cephalopods. Diet and stable isotopes did not differ between sexes. Regurgitation analysis indicate a dominance of cephalopods in both islands, but prey fish were important for Selvagem Grande in 2012 and cephalopods for Cima Islet in 2011. Both delta N-15 and delta C-13 values were significantly higher for Cima Islet than for Selvagem Grande, irrespective of year, season and tissue sampled. SIBER analysis showed smaller isotopic niches for the breeding period. Our study suggests that during years of poor environmental conditions Macaronesian shearwaters shift their foraging location to more pelagic waters, take more cephalopods and overall present a narrower isotopic niche.

However, it is critical to understand how marine mammals manage their energy expenditure and their diving behavior in environments where the predation risks are low and where survival is mainly linked to capacities to maintain physiological homeostasis and energy budget balance. Elephant seals are top marine predators that dive deeply and continuously when at sea. Using acoustic recorders deployed on two postbreeding southern elephant seals (SES) females, we developed methods to automatically estimate breathing frequency at the surface. Using this method, we found that seals took successive identical breaths at high frequency (0.29Hz) when recovering at the surface and that breath count was strongly related to postdive surfacing time. In addition, dive depth was the main factor explaining surfacing time through the effects of dive duration and total underwater swimming effort exerted. Finally, we found that recovery does not only occur over one dive timescale, but over a multidive time scale for one individual. The way these predators manage their recovery will determine how they respond to the change in oceanic water column structure in the future.

First, EcoTroph was used to synthesize the outputs of five pre-existing heterogeneous Ecopath models in a common framework, and thus to compare different ecosystems through their trophic spectra of biomass, catch, and fishing mortalities. This approach contributes to our understanding of ecosystem functioning, from both ecological and fisheries perspectives. Then, we assessed the sensitivity of each ecosystem to fishery, using EcoTroph simulations. For the five ecosystems considered, we simulated the effects of increasing or decreasing fishing mortalities on both the biomass and the catch per trophic class. Our results emphasize that the Mediterranean Sea is strongly affected by the depletion of high trophic level organisms. Results also show that fisheries impacts, at the trophic level scale, differ between ecosystems according to their trophic structure and exploitation patterns. A top-down compensation effect is observed in some simulations where a fishing-induced decrease in the biomass of predators impacts their prey, leading to an increase in the biomass at lower trophic levels. The results of this comparative analysis highlight that ecosystems where top-down controls are observed are less sensitive to variations in fishing mortality in terms of total ecosystem biomass. This suggests that the magnitude of top-down control present in a system can affect its stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Scaling matters: incorporating body composition into Weddell seal seasonal oxygen store comparisons reveals maintenance of aerobic capacities	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Aerobic dive limit; Body composition; Diving physiology; Enzymes; Myosin heavy chain; Oxygen stores	AIR-BREATHING VERTEBRATES; MAMMALIAN SKELETAL-MUSCLE; LIONS EUMETOPIAS-JUBATUS; NORTHERN ELEPHANT SEALS; DIVING METABOLIC-RATES; DIVE LIMIT; LEPTONYCHOTES-WEDDELLII; ELECTROPHORETIC SEPARATION; GLYCOLYTIC-ENZYMES; FORAGING BEHAVIOR	Adult Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) haul-out on the ice in October/November (austral spring) for the breeding season and reduce foraging activities for similar to 4 months until their molt in the austral fall (January/February). After these periods, animals are at their leanest and resume actively foraging for the austral winter. In mammals, decreased exercise and hypoxia exposure typically lead to decreased production of O-2-carrying proteins and muscle wasting, while endurance training increases aerobic potential. To test whether similar effects were present in marine mammals, this study compared the physiology of 53 post-molt female Weddell seals in the austral fall to 47 pre-breeding females during the spring in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Once body mass and condition (lipid) were controlled for, there were no seasonal changes in total body oxygen (TBO2) stores. Within each season, hematocrit and hemoglobin values were negatively correlated with animal size, and larger animals had lower mass-specific TBO2 stores. But because larger seals had lower mass-specific metabolic rates, their calculated aerobic dive limit was similar to smaller seals. Indicators of muscular efficiency, myosin heavy chain composition, myoglobin concentrations, and aerobic enzyme activities (citrate synthase and beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase) were likewise maintained across the year. The preservation of aerobic capacity is likely critical to foraging capabilities, so that following the molt Weddell seals can rapidly regain body mass at the start of winter foraging. In contrast, muscle lactate dehydrogenase activity, a marker of anaerobic metabolism, exhibited seasonal plasticity in this diving top predator and was lowest after the summer period of reduced activity.

Notwithstanding the importance of these species, there remain gaps in our knowledge on their movements, foraging, and trophic status in the early stage of life. METHODS: We measured the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in each annual growth band deposited in the dorsal spine from striped marlin caught off Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, to produce retrospective isotopic profiles that would enable us to detect any significant isotopic changes across development. The samples were analyzed using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. RESULTS: There was no relationship between the size of striped marlin and the delta N-15 values. Differences in delta N-15 mean values across different age classes were not significant and the variation in delta N-15 values through the marlins' life cycle was less than 2%. However, the mean delta N-15 values between individuals varied by up to 6%. The delta C-13 values increased as a function of age, and the mean delta C-13 values varied significantly between age classes. CONCLUSIONS: Fin spines can be used to construct retrospective isotopic histories for the investigation of trophic dynamics and migratory histories in billfishes, for which population dynamics are often poorly known.

The potential for this top-down contamination is greatest in coastal areas with productive marine ecosystems that provide ideal habitats for large marine mammal colonies that can number in the thousands. This recycling of MeHg was evidenced by comparing total mercury (HgT) and MeHg concentrations in seawater, and HgT in molted pelage of M. angustirostris, at the Ano Nuevo State Reserve pin-niped rookery with concentrations at neighboring coastal sites in Central California. Seawater MeHg concentrations around the rookery (average = 2.5 pM) were markedly higher than those at the comparison coastal sites (average = 0.30 pM), and were as high as 9.5 pM during the M. angustirostris molting season. As a consequence, excreta and molts from this marine mammal colony, and presumably other marine predator populations, constitute a major source of MeHg at the base of the local marine food chain.

Finding the Optimal for Reintroduction/Restocking Programs	PLOS ONE			English	Article							REARED JAPANESE FLOUNDER; SIZE-DEPENDENT MORTALITY; PARALICHTHYS-OLIVACEUS; ARGYROSOMUS-REGIUS; STOCK-ENHANCEMENT; POSTRELEASE SURVIVAL; NATURAL MORTALITY; RELEASE; JUVENILE; POPULATION	Most reintroduction and restocking programs consist of releasing captive-raised juveniles. The usefulness of these programs has been questioned, and therefore, quality control is advisable. However, evaluating restocking effectiveness is challenging because mortality estimation is required. Most methods for estimating mortality are based on tag recovery. In the case of fish, juveniles are tagged before release, and fishermen typically recover tags when fish are captured. The statistical models currently available for analyzing these data assume either constant mortality rates, fixed tag non-reporting rates, or both. Here, instead, we proposed a method that considers the mortality rate variability as a function of age/size of the released juveniles. Furthermore, the proposed method can disentangle natural from fishing mortality, analyzing the temporal distribution of the captures reported by fishermen from multiple release events. This method is demonstrated with a restocking program of a top-predator marine fish, the meagre (Argyrosomus regius), in the Balearic Islands. The estimated natural mortality just after release was very high for young fish (m(0) = 0.126 day(-1) for fish 180 days old), but it was close to zero for large/old fish. These large/old fish were more resilient to wild conditions, although a long time was needed to achieve a relevant reduction in natural mortality. Conversely, these large/old fish were more vulnerable to fishing, creating a trade-off in survival. The release age that maximizes the number of survivors after, for example, one year at liberty was estimated to be 1,173 days. However, the production cost of relatively old fish is high, and only a few fish can be produced and released within a realistic budget. Therefore, in the case of the meagre, increasing the number of released fish will have no or scarce effects on restocking success. Conversely, it is advisable implement measures to reduce the high natural mortality of young juveniles and/or the length of time needed to improve fish resilience.

Simulating bottom-up effects on predator productivity and consequences for the rebuilding timeline of a depleted population	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Simulation modeling; Bottom-up forcing; Predator-prey dynamics; Functional response; Reproductive numerical response	FLOUNDER PARALICHTHYS-DENTATUS; MAXIMUM REPRODUCTIVE RATE; ANCHOVY ANCHOA-MITCHILLI; MARINE TROPHIC LEVELS; CHESAPEAKE-BAY; SUMMER FLOUNDER; FOOD-WEB; COPEPOD PRODUCTION; BIOENERGETICS MODELS; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE	Bottom-up control within ecosystems is characterized, in part, by predator populations exhibiting growth and recruitment changes in response to variability in prey density or production. Annual prey availability can vary more than 10-fold in marine ecosystems, with prey experiencing a dramatic increase or pulse in production within some years. To assess the bottom-up effects of such pulses on predator growth, production, and fisheries management, we developed an age-specific, predator-prey simulation model (parameterized for summer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus) based on simple hypothesized mechanisms for consumption, growth, and population dynamics. Pulses in each of the three modeled prey groups (small crustaceans, forage fish, larger fish prey) generated different magnitudes of change in predator weight-at-age (w), spawning stock biomass (S), fishery yield (Y), and recruitment (R), due to ontogenetic differences in growth potential and dietary composition across predator age classes. Increases in productivity of small forage fishes generated the greatest gains in predator w, S, Y, and R, relative to pulses of the other prey groups. Median increases in R following a prey pulse were minimal (<4%) except under high fishing rates that stimulated a stronger compensatory response in the population (8-11% increase in R), demonstrating the interactive role of top-down and bottom-up effects on predator productivity. Seasonal migration patterns determined the degree of spatiotemporal overlap of predators with the spatially constrained pulses in prey production. Prey pulses reduced the median time required for depleted populations to be rebuilt by 0-5% following declines in fishing pressure. Reductions in time to recovery were highly variable due to recruitment stochasticity, but stock recovery was more sensitive to the severity of harvest control measures than to availability of the non-limiting prey. Understanding the relative magnitudes of such bottom-up processes, particularly in the presence of varied fishing pressure can aid in developing ecosystem approaches to fisheries management that account for such ecological interactions more explicitly.

Large predatory coral trout species unlikely to meet increasing energetic demands in a warming ocean	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; REEF FISHES; FOOD SECURITY; TEMPERATURE; ECOLOGY; PHYSIOLOGY; SIZE; LIFE; ECOSYSTEMS; PACIFIC	Increased ocean temperature due to climate change is raising metabolic demands and energy requirements of marine ectotherms. If productivity of marine systems and fisheries are to persist, individual species must compensate for this demand through increasing energy acquisition or decreasing energy expenditure. Here we reveal that the most important coral reef fishery species in the Indo-west Pacific, the large predatory coral trout Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), can behaviourally adjust food intake to maintain body-condition under elevated temperatures, and acclimate over time to consume larger meals. However, these increased energetic demands are unlikely to be met by adequate production at lower trophic levels, as smaller prey species are often the first to decline in response to climate-induced loss of live coral and structural complexity. Consequently, ubiquitous increases in energy consumption due to climate change will increase top-down competition for a dwindling biomass of prey, potentially distorting entire food webs and associated fisheries.

Nevertheless, jellyfish initiated trophic cascades and bottom-up influences impacting lower trophic levels have received limited attention. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify simultaneous top-down and bottom-up effects of a common jellyfish, Cyanea capillata, in a natural plankton community during autumn. Treatments were 0, 2 or 5 jellyfish per 2.5 m(3) mesocosm, four replicates each, with initial additions of inorganic nutrients. Primary and bacterial production, species abundance and composition of several trophic levels and nutrient and carbon dynamics were followed during the 8-day experiment. Multivariate statistics and generalized additive mixed modelling were applied to test whether jellyfish carbon concentration (0- 1.26 mg jellyC L-1) in the mesocosms affected the variables monitored. Unexpected negligible predatory impact of jellyfish on mesozooplankton was observed, potentially related to jellyfish senescence. Community compositions of bacteria, phytoplankton and mesozooplankton changed with time, but did not differ between treatments. However, nutrient regeneration by jellyfish was evident, and jellyfish had a positive impact on total and specific bacterial production, total primary production and the >10 mu m chlorophyll a fraction. Bottom-up influences from abundant jellyfish could thus stimulate productivity in nutrient depleted autumnal surface waters.

Here we present the California Current Predator Diet Database (CCPDD) for the California Current region of the Pacific Ocean over the past century, assimilating over 190 published records of predator food habits for over 100 predator species and 32 categories of forage taxa (species or groups of similar species). Literature searches targeted all predators that consumed forage species: seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony and cartilaginous fishes, and a predatory invertebrate. Diet data were compiled into a relational database. Analysis of the CCPDD highlighted differences in predator diet data availability based on geography, time period and predator taxonomy, as well as prominent prey categories. The top 5 forage taxa with the most predators included juvenile rockfish, northern anchovy, euphausiid krill, Pacific herring and market squid. Predator species with abundant data included Pacific hake, common murre, and California sea lion. Most diet data were collected during the summer; the lack of winter data will restrict future use of the CCPDD to understand seasonal patterns in predator diet unless more such data become available. Increased synthesis of historical information can provide new resources to understand patterns in the role of forage species in predator diet. Increased publication and/or accessibility of long-term datasets and data-sharing will further foster the synthesis of information intended to inform the management, conservation and understanding of marine food webs.

One such top predator, Japanese sea bass Lateolabrax japonicus, helps to balance the structure of the coastal marine ecosystem through predation. In this study, accelerometry was applied to the Japanese sea bass to estimate its energy expenditure under natural conditions. We attached accelerometers to five wild fish and measured metabolic rates such as the oxygen consumption rate (, mg O-2 kg(-1) min(-1)) using a swim tunnel. Body beat frequency (BBF) was measured using the accelerometer. The BBF was correlated with the tail beat frequency (TBF) by analyzing video recordings. was related to swimming speed (U), TBF, and BBF. We estimated the standard (45.9 kJ kg(-1) day(-1)) and active (124.0 kJ kg(-1) day(-1)) metabolic rates when fish were not swimming and when they were swimming at the optimum swimming speed, respectively. The energy required to compensate for the above metabolic rates are between 83.3 and 275.6 kJ kg(-1) day(-1) using an assimilation efficiency of 0.7 and assuming that the growth rate is zero. These costs were comparable to consuming one or two prey fish per day (e.g., Japanese sardine: mean total length 155 +/- A SD 6 mm).

Thermal behaviour and the prospect spread of an invasive benthic top predator onto the Euro-Arctic shelves	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Arctic shelves; invasive species; Kamchatka red king crab; Paralithodes camtschaticus; prospect spread; realised and potential habitats; thermal behaviour	RED KING CRAB; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BARENTS SEA; PARALITHODES-CAMTSCHATICUS; CONSERVATION BIOGEOGRAPHY; NORWEGIAN WATERS; POLAR COD; TEMPERATURE; LITHODIDAE; GROWTH	AimA focal task for invasion biology is to identify the environmental variables and biological traits that set and underpin realised and potential habitats of invasive species. Ecophysiology provides powerful empirical knowledge that connects theory with natural phenomena and may improve the accuracy of species distribution modelling. We used the introduced Kamchatka red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus of the Barents Sea as a prime case to show how thermal behaviour may drive the spreading of a marine invader in context of ocean warming. Finally, we discuss the conceivable consequences for a poleward spread of invasive top predators on native marine biota, conservation and management policies. LocationBarents Sea, Euro-Arctic shelves, Northeast Atlantic. MethodsWe used novel and non-manipulative tests which allowed adult red king crab to freely select and monitor ambient temperature in situ across a<1-14 degrees C gradient by means of a temperature data storage tag attached to the carapace. ResultsAdult red king crab, irrespective of body size, maturation stage and nutritional state, (1) displays clear behavioural thermoregulation in a hetero-thermal environment and, (2) conclusively selects temperatures in the coldest end of a gradient and avoids temperatures >4 degrees C. The final thermal preferendum matches completely present day Arctic shelf temperatures north and east in the Barents Sea. Main conclusionsThis is the first published study on the thermal behaviour of a marine invasive top predator. Our tests and the concurrent realised habitat north-east of Kola Peninsula suggest that the introduced red king crab is capable of invading the Euro-Arctic shelves in less than three decades. We argue that current management practices of the introduced red king crab compromise Arctic biodiversity and conservation and, to counteract further spreading, we recommend free fisheries on this species across its entire distributional area in the Northeast Atlantic.

However, the effects of overfishing and collapse of large top predators on the broad-scale biodiversity of oceanic ecosystems remain largely unexplored. Populations of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were overfished and several collapsed in the early 1990s across Atlantic Canada, providing a unique opportunity to study potential ecosystem-level effects of the reduction of a dominant predator on fish biodiversity, and to identify how such effects might interact with other environmental factors, such as changes in climate, over time. We combined causal modelling with model selection and multimodel inference to analyse 41years of fishery-independent survey data (1970-2010) and quantify ecosystem-level effects of overfishing and climate variation on the biodiversity of fishes across a broad area (172000km(2)) of the Scotian Shelf. We found that alpha and beta diversity increased with decreases in cod occurrence; fish communities were less homogeneous and more variable in systems where cod no longer dominated. These effects were most pronounced in the colder north-eastern parts of the Scotian Shelf. Our results provide strong evidence that intensive harvesting (and collapse) of marine apex predators can have large impacts on biodiversity, with far-reaching consequences for ecological stability across an entire ecosystem.

Spatial distribution of fishes in a Northwest Atlantic ecosystem in relation to risk of predation by a marine mammal	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						behaviour-mediated top-down effects; non-consumptive predator effects; predator-induced habitat selection; predator-prey interactions	COD GADUS-MORHUA; ST-LAWRENCE; SOUTHERN GULF; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS; HALICHOERUS-GRYPUS; NATURAL MORTALITY; PREY INTERACTIONS; SHARK PREDATION; TOP PREDATOR	Numerous studies have shown that, at spatial scales of metres to several kilometres, animals balance the trade-off between foraging success and predation mortality by increasing their use of safer but less profitable habitats as predation risk increases. However, it is less clear whether prey respond similarly at the larger spatiotemporal scales of many ecosystems. We determine whether this behaviour is evident in a large marine ecosystem, the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL, 75000km(2)) over a 42-year period. This ecosystem is characterized by a recent increase in the abundance of a large marine predator, the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus Fabricius), by more than an order of magnitude. We compared changes in spatial distribution over the 1971-2012 period between important prey of grey seals (Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L.; white hake, Urophycis tenuis Mitchill; and thorny skate, Amblyraja radiata Donovan) and non-prey fishes. Distribution was modelled using generalized additive models incorporating spatially variable effects of predation risk, density dependence and water temperature. Distributions of cod, hake and skate were strongly related to risk of predation by seals, with distribution shifting into lower risk areas as predation risk increased. Non-prey species did not show similar changes in habitat use. Spatial variation in fish condition suggests that these low-risk areas are also less profitable for cod and skate in terms of food availability. The effects of density dependence and water temperature were also important in models, but did not account for the changes in habitat use as the risk of predation increased. These results indicate that these fish are able to assess and respond to spatial variation in predation risk at very large spatial scales. They also suggest that non-consumptive risk' effects may be an important component of the declines in productivity of seal prey in this ecosystem, and of the indirect effects at lower trophic levels.

Recently, the North American white-fingered mud crab, Rhithropanopeus harrisii, has invaded the Northern Baltic Sea. This is an area where no native crab species exist, and the addition of a novel functional species to the low species diversity of the Baltic Sea could have large community-level impacts i.e. modifying biotic interactions and/or altering ecosystem functioning. We examined the predatory behavior of introduced R. harrisii both in the laboratory and field focusing in shallow, hard bottom habitats dominated by the alga Fucus vesiculosus. In the laboratory environment, R. harrisii was an effective predator of littoral grazers, readily consuming both sessile fauna (Mytilus trossulus) and also mobile species such as isopods (Idotea balthica) and gammarid amphipods (Gammarus sp.). When studying the predation of different sized prey items, R. harrisii preyed upon small and medium sized prey of both mobile and sessile species. However, in the field experiment with the native faunal community associated with F. vesiculosus, R. harrisii negatively impacted only the abundance of the snail Theodoxus fluviatilis, possibly through indirect effects. Nevertheless, R. harrisii significantly decreased both the prey species richness and diversity but not the total number of potential prey individuals associated with F. vesiculosus. In conclusion, predatory behavior of this novel crab has the potential to impact the native macroinvertebrate littoral community, but the realized predation pressure in the field is lower than could be expected from laboratory experiments.

Feeding ecology of common demersal elasmobranch species in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica inferred from stable isotope and stomach content analyses	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Costa Rica; Diet overlap; Eastern Tropical Pacific; Elasmobranch; Mesopredator; Trophic ecology	STANDARDIZED DIET COMPOSITIONS; RAY TORPEDO-CALIFORNICA; DEEP-WATER FISHERY; CENTRAL-AMERICA; NEGAPRION-BREVIROSTRIS; TRIAKIS-SEMIFASCIATA; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; MARINE PREDATORS; HAWAIIAN WATERS; TROPHIC LEVELS	Knowledge of the feeding ecology and trophic interactions of marine species is essential to understanding food web dynamics and developing ecosystem-based management approaches. Given that many top predatory fishes have experienced large population declines from coastal ecosystems, it is critical to understand the role of smaller, mesopredators in coastal food webs. This study used stomach content (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) of muscle tissue (delta C-13, delta N-15) to examine the feeding ecology of four common demersal elasmobranchs (Mustelus henlei, Raja velezi, Zapteryx xyster and Torpedo peruana) from the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, Central America. Specifically, we investigated: (i) size- and sex-related changes in diet; (ii) dietary changes between seasons; (iii) dietary changes across depth and latitudinal gradients; and (iv) the degree of diet overlap among species. SCA showed that M. henlei, R. velezi and Z. xyster were feeding on a wide range of teleost and decapod species, whereas teleosts dominated the diet of T. peruana. Torpedo peruana had a lower prey diversity and dietary breath than the other species. Interestingly, SIA revealed a significantly larger isotopic niche breath in Z. xyster, indicating that SIA can provide a broader perspective of diet than SCA. Both SCA and SIA showed relatively low dietary overlap among species, except between R. velezi and Z. xyster which have a similar size, mouth morphology and potentially feeding behaviour. Latitude and size were identified as important drivers of the feeding ecology of elasmobranchs; however, their effect varied considerably among species and was often influenced by other factors such as sex and depth. Season had little influence on elasmobranch diet, but our data suggested that isotopic baseline values differ between geographic regions due to differences in local biogeochemical processes and/or prey availability, and possibly in response to seasonal nutrient fluctuations. This may also indicate that some of these elasmobranchs tend to use more localized habitats along the coast. The present study increased our understanding of the feeding ecology of common demersal elasmobranch species. Moreover, trophic information of elasmobranchs provided an important baseline record to understanding how trawling fisheries may impact demersal ecosystems in Costa Rica and the Central American region.

To investigate penguins' seasonally changing FTD as a function of foraging population size-previously investigated indirectly-we used bio-logging to determine the penguins' 3-dimensional foraging volume, while an autonomous glider quantified the depth, abundance, and distribution of potential prey. As numbers of foraging penguins and cetaceans increased, penguins spent more time on foraging trips, traveling farther and deeper, and their diet included more fish, as average maximum depth of krill increased from 45 to 65 m, and that of small fish also deepened, but only from 51 to 57 m. With a need to forage at greater depths for in creasingly over lapping prey, the penguins consumed more of the energy-dense fish. Krill depth was negatively correlated with chlorophyll (a proxy for krill food), indicating an uncoupling between the two and the overwhelming importance of predation avoidance by the krill relative to food acquisition. Results support the hypotheses that (1) predators remove the grazers from Ross Sea surface waters, controlling their vertical distributions; and (2) the food web has a 'wasp-waist' structure, in which middle-and upper-trophic levels are controlled top-down, whereas phytoplank ton production and accumulation are regulated bottom-up, largely independent of grazer control. Ross Sea models need revision to reflect this food web structure.

The unique ecology of human predators	SCIENCE			English	Article							GLOBAL FISHERIES; TOP; EXPLOITATION; EXTINCTIONS; ECOSYSTEM; EVOLUTION; COLLAPSE; DECLINE; WILD	Paradigms of sustainable exploitation focus on population dynamics of prey and yields to humanity but ignore the behavior of humans as predators. We compared patterns of predation by contemporary hunters and fishers with those of other predators that compete over shared prey (terrestrial mammals and marine fishes). Our global survey (2125 estimates of annual finite exploitation rate) revealed that humans kill adult prey, the reproductive capital of populations, at much higher median rates than other predators (up to 14 times higher), with particularly intense exploitation of terrestrial carnivores and fishes. Given this competitive dominance, impacts on predators, and other unique predatory behavior, we suggest that humans function as an unsustainable "super predator," which-unless additionally constrained by managers-will continue to alter ecological and evolutionary processes globally.

Halogenated Natural Products in Dolphins: Brain-Blubber Distribution and Comparison with Halogenated Flame Retardants	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY METHOD; DECHLORANE PLUS; MARINE BIOTA; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; ORGANOBROMINE COMPOUNDS; ORGANOHALOGEN COMPOUNDS	Halogenated natural products (MHC-1, TriBHD, TetraBHD, Me0-PBDEs, Ql, and related PMBPs) and halogenated flame retardants (PBDEs, HBB, Dec 602, Dec 603, and DP) in blubber and brain are reported from five Alboran Sea delphinids (Spain). Both HNPs and HFRs were detected in brain, implying that they are able to surpass the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain, which represents a new finding for some compounds, such as Q1 and PMBPs, MHC-1, TriBHD, TetraBHD, or Dec 603. Moreover, some compounds (TetraBHD, BDE-153, or HBB) presented higher levels in brain than in blubber. This study evidence the high concentrations of HNPs in the marine environrnent, especially in top predators. It shows the importance of further monitoring these natural compounds and evaluating their potential toxicity, when most studies focus on anthropogenic compounds only. While no bioaccumulation was found for Sigma HNPs, Sigma HFRs increased significantly with body size for both common and striped dolphins. Studies evaluating BBB permeation mechanisms of these compounds together with their potential neurotoxic effects in dolphins are recommended.

Widespread declines of several Southern Ocean predators, including southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina, have been attributed to decreases in food availability following environmental changes. We used linear mixed models to examine temporal process variance in weaning mass (a key fitness component) of southern elephant seals at Marion Island over a 27-year period (19862013). We quantified the contribution of within-and between-year covariates to the total phenotypic variance in weaning mass and determined whether the observed reversal of population decline was associated with a continued increase in weaning mass, suggesting improvement in per capita food availability to adult females. Weaning mass initially increased rapidly with maternal age, but reached an asymptote when females were nine years old. Longitudinal data examining between-individual maternal differences suggested latent, age-independent maternal influences on weaning mass. Between-year differences accounted for only 6% of the total phenotypic variance in weaning mass. We found no evidence for a systematic trend in weaning mass, but model predicted weaning mass was 8.70 kg (95% CI = 2.14-14.73) lower during the 1980s, suggesting that food limitation may have been most severe during these years when the population was declining. Model support for a population size effect was entirely driven by the low weaning mass and comparatively high (but declining) population size from 1986 to 1988; subsequent variation in population size had no detectable influence on weaning mass. Remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentration within the seals' foraging distribution explained 45% of the between-year variation (1998-2013, n = 9) in weaning mass, with higher weaning mass in years of positive chlorophyll-a anomalies. Environmental variation associated with variability in the Southern Annular Mode poorly predicted temporal variation in weaning mass. Our long-term data on elephant seal weaning mass provides a perspective on variation in food availability in a pelagic environment which is poorly known. Examining the long-term regionally specific effects of environmental variability aids our understanding of how these predators interact with their environment.	[Oosthuizen, W.

Geographic and temporal dynamics of a global radiation and diversification in the killer whale	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						cetacean; habitat models; mitogenomics; phylogeography; single nucleotide polymorphism; speciation	POPULATION-STRUCTURE; ORCINUS-ORCA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORY; POSITIVE SELECTION; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; STATISTICAL-METHOD; DNA POLYMORPHISM; ICE AGES	Global climate change during the Late Pleistocene periodically encroached and then released habitat during the glacial cycles, causing range expansions and contractions in some species. These dynamics have played a major role in geographic radiations, diversification and speciation. We investigate these dynamics in the most widely distributed of marine mammals, the killer whale (Orcinus orca), using a global data set of over 450 samples. This marine top predator inhabits coastal and pelagic ecosystems ranging from the ice edge to the tropics, often exhibiting ecological, behavioural and morphological variation suggestive of local adaptation accompanied by reproductive isolation. Results suggest a rapid global radiation occurred over the last 350000years. Based on habitat models, we estimated there was only a 15% global contraction of core suitable habitat during the last glacial maximum, and the resources appeared to sustain a constant global effective female population size throughout the Late Pleistocene. Reconstruction of the ancestral phylogeography highlighted the high mobility of this species, identifying 22 strongly supported long-range dispersal events including interoceanic and interhemispheric movement. Despite this propensity for geographic dispersal, the increased sampling of this study uncovered very few potential examples of ancestral dispersal among ecotypes. Concordance of nuclear and mitochondrial data further confirms genetic cohesiveness, with little or no current gene flow among sympatric ecotypes. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that the glacial cycles influenced local populations in different ways, with no clear global pattern, but with secondary contact among lineages following long-range dispersal as a potential mechanism driving ecological diversification.

Feeding in the field is poorly known; however, isolates of an Antarctic M. rubrum strain are maintained in culture on a diet of Teleaulex/Plagioselmis/Geminigera-like cryptophytes, suggesting that cryptophyte presence may be an important factor controlling M. rubrum distribution and abundance in nature. We augmented field surveys with published findings to establish the distribution of both M. rubrum and a Geminigera-like cryptophyte in a range of East Antarctic aquatic environments. We also studied their overwinter abundances in Ace Lake to determine whether a predator-prey relationship existed between the two species in this natural enclosed ecosystem. The ciliate and the cryptophyte co-occurred in the majority of sites sampled which ranged widely in salinity (2.2-150 aEuro degrees) and temperature (-3.0-16 A degrees C). We observed a cyclic relationship in species abundances in Ace Lake, implying population growth for M. rubrum responded to changed cryptophyte abundance. Mesodinium rubrum likely exerts top-down pressure on cryptophyte abundances in natural enclosed ecosystems especially under low-light winter conditions. The ciliate can be considered an apex predator in highly truncated food webs.

It is only with the advent of high-speed computers and the recent popularisation of geographical information systems (GIS) that terrain attributes have begun to be quantitatively measured in three-dimensional space and related to wildlife dynamics, making the well-established field of geomorphometry (or digital terrain modelling') a discipline of growing appeal to biologists. Although a diverse array of numerical metrics is now available to describe the shape, geometry and physical properties of natural habitats, few of these are known to, or adequately used by, ecologists. In this review, we examine the nature and usage of 56 geomorphometrics extracted from the ecological modelling literature over a period of 32 years (1979-2011). We show that, in studies of mobile predators, numerous topographic variables have largely been overlooked in favour of single basic metrics that do not, on their own, fully capture the complexity of continuous landscapes. Based on a simulation approach, we assess the redundancy and correlation structure of these metrics and demonstrate that a majority are highly collinear. We highlight a suite of 7-8 complementary metrics which best explain topographic patterns across a bathymetric grid of the west Australian seafloor, and contend that field and analytical protocols should prioritise variables of these types, particularly when the responses of predator populations to physical habitat features are of interest. We suggest that prominent structures such as canyons, seamounts or mountain chains can serve as useful proxies for predator hotspots, especially in remote locations where access to high-resolution biological data is often limited.

On the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs), large populations of top predators import substantial amounts of nutrients from the oceans to the islands. Guano runoff from the islands increases the availability of nutrients in the nearshore marine environment, supporting phytoplankton blooms. We apply food web models to the PEIs marine ecosystem to investigate food web responses to variability in resource subsidies. Modelled scenarios of island-associated blooms indicated small effects on the ecosystem under both normal bloom conditions and when the input of blooms was removed entirely. Benthic communities benefited most strongly from blooms and a fivefold increase in bloom production had broadly positive impacts throughout the entire food web, including the pelagic food web. Land-based predators were shown to contribute significantly to nearshore ecosystem production via their contributions to ammonia runoff. Transfers of material across the land-sea interface were estimated to contribute 0.73 t N km(-2) y(-1) to the nearshore ammonium pool. The effects of removing terrestrial nutrient input were very small when 100% of nutrient runoff was converted to island-associated bloom phytoplankton while the macrophyte production rate was held constant. If, however, macrophyte production was also supported in part or wholly by terrestrial nutrient runoff, the ecosystem-level effects of runoff variability were much greater and more broadly distributed throughout the food web. Given the potential of habitat linkages to alter or structure communities, populations, and environments, it is important to incorporate land-sea linkages into ecological models.

NOV.; ORGANIC-MATTER; AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS; MICROBIAL CONSORTIA	Biostimulation through the addition of inorganic nutrients has been the most widely practiced bioremediation strategy in oil-polluted marine waters. However, little attention has so far been paid to the microbial food web and the impact of top-down control that directly or indirectly influences the success of the bioremediation. We designed a mesocosm experiment using pre-filtered (< 50 mu m) surface seawater from the Bay of Banyuls-sur-Mer (North-Western Mediterranean Sea) and examined the top-down effect exerted by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and virus-like particles (VLP) on prokaryotic abundance, activity and diversity in the presence or absence of diesel fuel. Prokaryotes, HNF and VLP abundances showed a predator-prey succession, with a co-development of HNF and VLP. In the polluted system, we observed a stronger impact of viral lysis on prokaryotic abundances than in the control. Analysis of the diversity revealed that a bloom of Vibrio sp. occurred in the polluted mesocosm. That bloom was rapidly followed by a less abundant and more even community of predation-resistant bacteria, including known hydrocarbon degraders such as Oleispira spp. and Methylophaga spp. and opportunistic bacteria such as Percisivirga spp., Roseobacter spp. and Phaeobacter spp. The shift in prokaryotic dominance in response to viral lysis provided clear evidence of the 'killing the winner' model. Nevertheless, despite clear effects on prokaryotic abundance, activity and diversity, the diesel degradation was not impacted by top-down control. The present study investigates for the first time the functioning of a complex microbial network (including VLP) using a nutrient-based biostimulation strategy and highlights some key processes useful for tailoring bioremediation.

J	Pinheiro, HT; Joyeux, JC				Pinheiro, Hudson Tercio; Joyeux, Jean-Christophe			The role of recreational fishermen in the removal of target reef fishes	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Community structure; Conservation; Franceses Island; Angling; Spearfishing; Trindade Island	STRUCTURE PATTERNS; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; ATLANTIC; ISLAND; COAST; PERSPECTIVE; POPULATION; DENSITY; AREAS	Captures by recreational anglers and spearfishermen at preserved (PR) and overexploited (OR) Brazilian reefs were studied. The selection exercised by fishermen was established by comparison between catch composition and the fish community structure determined through underwater visual census. Fishing activities were more regular at PR, with more participants, lower duration and larger-sized captures than at OR. Activities at PR showed a strong selection towards top predator fishes. Activities at OR showed lower selectivity for predators with accompanying high rates of capture for conspicuous herbivore and invertivore fishes. Our findings support that 1) CPUE is not necessarily different among preserved and overfished sites, and 2) that even in an overfished environment, recreational fishing activities keep targeting large predatory species of diminishing size. This scenario is consistent with those of commercial fishing where the catch composition is continuously evolving toward species with shorter and faster life cycles in accordance to the gradual simplification of the community structure.

The model included previously modeled areas in the NW Mediterranean (the Gulf of Lions and the Southern Catalan Sea) and expanded their ranges, covering 45,547 km(2), with depths from 0 to 1000 in. The study area was chosen to specifically account for the connectivity between the areas and shared fish stocks and fleets. Input data were based on local scientific surveys and fishing statistics, published data on stomach content analyses, and the application of empirical equations to estimate consumption and production rates. The model was composed of 54 functional groups, from primary producers to top predators, and Spanish and French fishing fleets were considered. Results were analyzed using ecological indicators and compared with outputs from ecosystem models developed in the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Cadiz prior to this study. Results showed that the main trophic flows were associated with detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Several high trophic level organisms (such as dolphins, benthopelagic cephalopods, large demersal fishes from the continental shelf, and other large pelagic fishes), and the herbivorous salema fish, were identified as keystone groups within the ecosystem. Results confirmed that fishing impact was high and widespread throughout the food web. The comparative approach highlighted that, despite productivity differences, the ecosystems shared common features in structure and functioning traits such as the important role of detritus, the dominance of the pelagic fraction in terms of flows and the importance of benthic pelagic coupling.

To predict possible adverse effects of pharmaceutical products on benthic biota, polychaetes Hediste diversicolor were exposed for 14-days to pharmaceutical-spiked sediments under laboratory conditions. Carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBP) and propranolol (PRO) at concentrations of 500 ng g(-1), 50 ng g(-1), 5 ng g(-1), 0.5 ng g(-1) and 0.05 ng g(-1), fluoxetine (FX) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) at concentrations of 100 ng g(-1), 10 ng g(-1), 1 ng g(-1), 0.1 ng g(-1) and 0.01 ng g(-1), including environmental concentrations (underlined), were spiked in marine sediment samples. After the exposure, cellular energy status (total lipids content - TLP; and mitochondrial electron transport activity - MET), metabolism of monoamines (monoamine oxidase activity - MAO) and inflammation properties (cyclooxygenase activity - COX) were observed in polychaetes. CBZ increased TLP content and MET activity, and decreased MAO activity in polychaetes. IBP did not interfere on the TLP level, but on the MET and MAO activities (environmental concentrations). FX did not cause changes in the energy status. Therefore, environmental concentration diminished MAO activity. EE2 did not affect the energy status, however, MAO activity was significantly lower in polychaetes exposed to environmental concentration. PRO increased TLP level in polychaetes, but not MET activity. MAO activity was significantly lower for polychaetes exposed to environmental concentration. Except FX, all pharmaceuticals showed anti-inflammatory properties confirmed by the decrease of COX activity. Pharmaceutical products affected H. diversicolor physiology and health. As a benthic top predator, adverse effects on sea-worms can potentially culminate in ecosystem perturbations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Maranho, L. A.; Martin-Diaz, M.

Here we report that the algal recovery in a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area did not derive from the increase in the traditional strong predators, but rather from the establishment of a previously unknown interaction between the thermophilic fish Thalassoma pavo and the seastar Marthasterias glacialis. The interaction resulted in elevated predation rates on sea urchins responsible for algal overgrazing. Manipulative experiments and field observations revealed that the proximity of the seastars triggered an escape response in sea urchins, extending their tube feet. Fishes exploited this behavior by feeding on the exposed tube feet, thus impairing urchin movement, and making them vulnerable to predation by the seastars. These findings suggest that predator diversity generated by MPA establishment can activate positive interactions among predators, with subsequent restoration of the ecosystem structure and function through cascading consumer impacts.

Insights from Coastal East Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; FISHERIES; PATTERNS; MAMMALS; MODELS; OCEAN; REEFS; ENVIRONMENT	Along the East African coast, marine top predators are facing an increasing number of anthropogenic threats which requires the implementation of effective and urgent conservation measures to protect essential habitats. Understanding the role that habitat features play on the marine top predator' distribution and abundance is a crucial step to evaluate the suitability of an existing Marine Protected Area (MPA), originally designated for the protection of coral reefs. We developed species distribution models (SDM) on the IUCN data deficient Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in southern Kenya. We followed a comprehensive ecological modelling approach to study the environmental factors influencing the occurrence and abundance of dolphins while developing SDMs. Through the combination of ensemble prediction maps, we defined recurrent, occasional and unfavourable habitats for the species. Our results showed the influence of dynamic and static predictors on the dolphins' spatial ecology: dolphins may select shallow areas (5-30 m), close to the reefs (<500 m) and oceanic fronts (<10 km) and adjacent to the 100m isobath (<5 km). We also predicted a significantly higher occurrence and abundance of dolphins within the MPA. Recurrent and occasional habitats were identified on large percentages on the existing MPA (47% and 57% using presence-absence and abundance models respectively). However, the MPA does not adequately encompass all occasional and recurrent areas and within this context, we propose to extend the MPA to incorporate all of them which are likely key habitats for the highly mobile species. The results from this study provide two key conservation and management tools: (i) an integrative habitat modelling approach to predict key marine habitats, and (ii) the first study evaluating the effectiveness of an existing MPA for marine mammals in the Western Indian Ocean.

A barnacle Balanus crenatus is a native foundation species in the shallow subtidal of the White Sea (65 degrees N), hosting a diverse (250+ species) assemblage of macrobenthic organisms. On mixed sediments live barnacles share primary substrates (shells and gravel) with numerous empty barnacle tests, 7% of which had drill holes of an unidentified origin. We manipulated the densities of (i) adult muricid whelks Boreotrophon clathratus (of previously unknown feeding habits), to check if they prey on barnacles, (ii) other predators to reveal their effect on juvenile Boreotrophon, and (iii) empty tests to assess the community-wide effect of predation on barnacles. The abundance of drilled empty tests in the field correlated with that of Boreotrophon. A year-long caging experiment clearly confirmed predation, showing the highest barnacle mortality and proportion of drilled tests in whelk enclosures, and the lowest-in predator exclosure treatments. Boreotrophon preferred the barnacles attached to conspecifics to those from primary substrates. Because of its scarcity Boreotrophon had a minor direct effect on barnacle abundance in the field. Yet, initially defaunated empty tests and live barnacles developed markedly different macrobenthic assemblages, suggesting a strong indirect effect of the predation. Juvenile Boreotrophon were 5-6 times less abundant in open and partial cages than in exclosures and enclosures, which indicates that the recruitment and, consequently, the abundance of Boreotrophon and its predation on Balanus are top-down controlled by apex predators. In contrast, in tropical and temperate intertidal the predation on barnacles is stronger and primarily limited by environmental stress and prey availability.

Multiple Stressors in a Top Predator Seabird: Potential Ecological Consequences of Environmental Contaminants, Population Health and Breeding Conditions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS; PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; SKUAS STERCORARIUS-SKUA; GREAT SKUAS; EGG-SIZE; ORGANOCHLORINE POLLUTANTS; REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; LARUS-HYPERBOREUS; FLAME-RETARDANT; GLAUCOUS GULL	Environmental contaminants may have impacts on reproduction and survival in wildlife populations suffering from multiple stressors. This study examined whether adverse effects of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) increased with poor population health and breeding conditions in three colonies (60-74 degrees N) of great skua (Stercorarius skua) in the north-eastern Atlantic (Shetland, Iceland and Bjornoya [Bear Island]). POPs (organochlorines [OCs] and polybrominated diphenyl ethers [BDEs]) were measured in plasma of incubating birds (n = 222), concentrations differing nearly tenfold among colonies: Bjornoya (2009) > Bjornoya (2010) > Iceland (2009) > Shetland (2009). Reproductive success (hatching success and chick survival) showed that breeding conditions were favourable in Shetland and at Bjornoya (2010), but were very poor in Iceland and at Bjornoya (2009). Biomarkers indicated that health was poor in the Shetland population compared to the other populations. Females whose chicks hatched late had high POP concentrations in all colonies except at Bjornoya (2010), and females losing their eggs at Bjornoya (2009) tended to have higher concentrations than those hatching. Moreover, there was a negative relationship between female POP concentrations and chick body condition at hatching in Iceland and at Bjornoya (2010). Supplementary feeding experiments were conducted, and in Iceland where feeding conditions were poor, significant negative relationships were found between female POP concentrations and daily growth-rate in first-hatched chicks of control nests, but not in food supplemented nests. This suggests that negative impacts of POPs were mitigated by improved feeding conditions. For second-chicks, there was a strong negative relationship between the female POP concentrations and growth-rate, but no effects of supplementary feeding. Lowered adult return-rate between breeding seasons with increasing POP loads were found both at Bjornoya (2009) and in Shetland, especially related to BDEs. This indicates stronger fitness consequences of POPs following seasons with very poor breeding conditions and/or high reproductive effort. This study suggests that the impacts of POPs may differ depending on population health and breeding conditions, and that even low concentrations of POPs could have ecological consequences during adverse circumstances. This is important with regard to risk assessment of biomagnifying contaminants in marine ecosystems.

Indirect effects of predators control herbivore richness and abundance in a benthic eelgrass (Zostera marina) mesograzer community	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						bottom-up; competitive exclusion; composition; food web; marine; predator-mediated coexistence; prey; seagrass; top-down; trophic interaction	SPECIES-ENERGY RELATIONSHIP; BOTTOM-UP FORCES; REAL FOOD WEBS; TOP-DOWN; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; MOBILE EPIFAUNA; STOCHASTIC-PROCESSES; SEAGRASS ECOSYSTEMS; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; TROPHIC CASCADES	1. Herbivore communities can be sensitive to changes in predator pressure (top-down effects) and resource availability (bottom-up effects) in a wide range of systems. However, it remains unclear whether such top-down and bottom-up effects reflect direct impacts of predators and/or resources on herbivores, or are indirect, reflecting altered interactions among herbivore species. 2. We quantified direct and indirect effects of bottom-up and top-down processes on an eelgrass (Zostera marina) herbivore assemblage. In a field experiment, we factorially manipulated water column nutrients (with Osmocote TM slow-release fertilizer) and predation pressure (with predator exclusion cages) and measured the effects on herbivore abundance, richness and beta diversity. We examined likely mechanisms of community responses by statistically exploring the response of individual herbivore species to trophic manipulations. 3. Predators increased herbivore richness and total abundance, in both cases through indirect shifts in community composition. Increases in richness occurred through predator suppression of common gammarid amphipod species (Monocorophium acherusicum and Photis brevipes), permitting the inclusion of rarer gammarid species (Aoroides columbiae and Pontogeneia rostrata). Increased total herbivore abundance reflected increased abundance of a caprellid amphipod species (Caprella sp.), concurrent with declines in the abundance of other common species. Furthermore, predators decreased beta diversity by decreasing variability in Caprella sp. abundance among habitat patches. 4. Osmocote TM fertilization increased nutrient concentrations locally, but nutrients dissipated to background levels within 3 m of the fertilizer. Nutrient addition weakly affected the herbivore assemblage, not affecting richness and increasing total abundance by increasing one herbivore species (Caprella sp.). Nutrient addition did not affect beta diversity. 5. We demonstrated that assemblage-level effects of trophic manipulations on community structure are the result of distinct and often indirect responses of herbivore species. These results underscore the importance of understanding herbivore-herbivore interactions in a system commonly subjected to both eutrophication and overfishing.

Long-term (1993-2013) changes in macrozooplankton off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS			English	Article						Southern Ocean; Krill; Zooplankton; Climate; Sea ice	KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; ISLANDS SOUTHERN-OCEAN; SEA-ICE; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FOOD-WEB; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS	The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, and where a high apex predator biomass is supported in large part by macrozooplankton. We examined trends in summer (January-February) abundance of major taxa of macrozooplankton along the WAP over two decades (1993-2013) and their relationship with environmental parameters (sea ice, atmospheric climate indices, sea surface temperature, and phytoplankton biomass and productivity). Macrozooplankton were collected from the top 120 m of the water column in a mid-Peninsula study region divided into latitudinal (North, South, and Far South) and cross-shelf (coastal, shelf, slope) sub-regions. Trends for krill species included a 5-year cycle in abundance peaks (positive anomalies) for Euphausia superba, but no directional long-term trend, and an increase in Thysanoessa macrura in the North; variability in both species was strongly influenced by primary production 2-years prior. E. crystallorophias abundance was best explained by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI), and was more abundant in higher ice conditions. The salp Salpa thompsoni and thecosome pteropod Limacina helicina cycled between negative and positive anomalies in the North, but showed increasing positive anomalies in the South over time. Variation in salp and pteropod abundance was best explained by SAM and the MEI, respectively, and both species were more abundant in lower ice conditions. There was a long-term increase in some carnivorous gelatinous zooplankton (polychaete worm Tomopteris spp.) and amphipods. Abundance of Pseudosagitta spp. chaetognaths was closely related to SAM, with higher abundance tied to lower ice conditions. Longterm changes and sub-decadal cycles of WAP macrozooplankton community composition may affect energy transfer to higher trophic levels, and alter biogeochemical cycling in this seasonally productive and sensitive polar ecosystem.

Here, we investigated how male body size, male-male competition, and water turbidity influence nest-building behaviour in the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus), a marine fish with exclusive paternal care. We found that environmental and social factors affected the nest characteristics of small and large males differently. In particular, association between male size and the level of nest elaboration (i.e. the amount of sand piled on top of the nest) was positive only under clear water conditions. Similarly, male size and nest entrance size were positively associated only in the absence of competition. Such interactions may, in turn, help to explain the persistence of variation in reproductive behaviours, which-due to their importance in offspring survival-are otherwise expected to be under strong balancing selection.

Some oceanic pelagic shark species have been shown to aggregate in specific regions to mate and/or exploit abundant food resources. The oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus, a subtropical, ectothermic, oceanic pelagic shark that has experienced severe population declines, aggregates seasonally around Cat Island (CI) in The Bahamas. Large pelagic teleosts (e. g. billfish, tunas, and dolphinfish) are abundant in this region and oceanic whitetips are anecdotally reported to feed heavily on recreationally caught teleosts. However, it was unknown whether feeding habits at CI substantially differ from longer-term feeding habits. We used tag-recapture to assess site-fidelity of adult oceanic whitetips to CI and stable isotope analysis (SIA) of 2 different tissues (blood plasma and white muscle) to compare short-and long-term feeding patterns. The relatively high recapture rate (20.3%) confirmed that individual whitetips exhibit site-fidelity to CI. The aggregation consisted of adult individuals; females were more common, more than half were gravid, and no physical or behavioral evidence of mating or parturition was observed at CI. SIA-based Bayesian mixing model estimates of short-term (near CI) diets showed more large pelagic teleosts (72%) than in long-term diets (47%), showing a spatiotemporal difference in oceanic whitetip feeding habits. This suggests that availability of large teleost prey is a possible mechanism underpinning site-fidelity and aggregation of whitetips at CI. These results provide insight into the function of one of the last known aggregations of this once-abundant top predator.

We introduce this special issue by briefly summarizing successes and failures of Baltic environmental management in the following 40 years. The loads of many polluting substances have been greatly reduced, but legacy pollution slows recovery. Top predator populations have recovered, and human exposure to potential toxins has been reduced. The cod stock has partially recovered. Nutrient loads are decreasing, but deep-water anoxia and cyanobacterial blooms remain extensive, and climate change threatens the advances made. Ecosystem-based management is the agreed principle, but in practice the various environmental problems are still handled separately, since we still lack both basic ecological knowledge and appropriate governance structures for managing them together, in a true ecosystem approach.

During the spring in 2012 and 2013, cells of Dinophysis acuminata complex were always present, sometimes at relatively high abundances (max. 1143 cells L-1), likely the main source of okadaic acid (OA) in the plankton (max. 34 ng L-1). Dinophysis caudata occurred at lower cell densities in 2013 when the lipophilic toxins pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) and PTX-2 seco acid were detected in plankton and mussel samples. Here, we report for the first time the accumulation of DSTs in octopuses, probably linked to the consumption of contaminated bivalves. Perna perna mussels were consistently contaminated with different DSTs (max. 42 mu g kg(-1)), and all octopuses analyzed (n = 5) accumulated OA in different organs/tissues: digestive glands (DGs) > arms > gills > kidneys > stomach + intestine. Additionally, similar concentrations of 7-O-palmytoyl OA and 7-O-palmytoly dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) were frequently detected in the hepatopancreas of P. perna and DGs of O. vulgaris. Therefore, octopuses can be considered a potential vector of DSTs to both humans and top predators such as marine mammals.

Coping with Ocean Acidification in the Midst of Many Stressors	OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS; SEA-URCHIN LARVAE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; COASTAL WATERS; CORAL-REEFS; IMPACTS; OXYGEN; PH	Oceanic and coastal waters are acidifying due to processes dominated in the open ocean by increasing atmospheric CO2 and dominated in estuaries and some coastal waters by nutrient-fueled respiration. The patterns and severity of acidification, as well as its effects, are modified by the host of stressors related to human activities that also influence these habitats. Temperature, deoxygenation, and changes in food webs are particularly important co-stressors because they are pervasive, and both their causes and effects are often mechanistically linked to acidification. Development of a theoretical underpinning to multiple stressor research that considers physiological, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives is needed because testing all combinations of stressors and stressor intensities experimentally is impossible. Nevertheless, use of a wide variety of research approaches is a logical and promising strategy for improving understanding of acidification and its effects. Future research that focuses on spatial and temporal patterns of stressor interactions and on identifying mechanisms by which multiple stressors affect individuals, populations, and ecosystems is critical. It is also necessary to incorporate consideration of multiple stressors into management, mitigation, and adaptation to acidification and to increase public and policy recognition of the importance of addressing acidification in the context of the suite of other stressors with which it potentially interacts.

A new method for resolving uncertainty of energy requirements in large water breathers: the "mega-flume' seagoing swim-tunnel respirometer	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						allometry; biomass; daily energy expenditure; ectotherm; feeding requirements; field metabolic rate; power curve; tuna; white shark; wind tunnel	FIELD METABOLIC-RATE; BODY-MASS; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; OCEANIC PREDATOR; SHARKS; ANIMALS; EFFICIENCY; RATES; FISH; PREY	Body size is a key determinant of metabolic rate, but logistical constraints have led to a paucity of energetics measurements from large water-breathing animals. As a result, estimating energy requirements of large fish generally relies on extrapolation of metabolic rate from individuals of lower body mass using allometric relationships that are notoriously variable. Swim-tunnel respirometry is the gold standard' for measuring active metabolic rates in water-breathing animals, yet previous data are entirely derived from body masses <10kg - at least one order of magnitude lower than the body masses of many top-order marine predators. Here, we describe the design and testing of a new method for measuring metabolic rates of large water-breathing animals: a c.26000L seagoing mega-flume' swim-tunnel respirometer. We measured the swimming metabolic rate of a 21-m, 36-kg zebra shark Stegostoma fasciatum within this new mega-flume and compared the results to data we collected from other S.fasciatum (38-477kg body mass) swimming in static respirometers and previously published measurements of active metabolic rate measurements from other shark species. The mega-flume performed well during initial tests, with intra- and interspecific comparisons suggesting accurate metabolic rate measurements can be obtained with this new tool. Inclusion of our data showed that the scaling exponent of active metabolic rate with mass for sharks ranging from 013 to 477kg was 079; a similar value to previous estimates for resting metabolic rates in smaller fishes. We describe the operation and usefulness of this new method in the context of our current uncertainties surrounding energy requirements of large water-breathing animals. We also highlight the sensitivity of mass-extrapolated energetic estimates in large aquatic animals and discuss the consequences for predicting ecosystem impacts such as trophic cascades.

J	Hill, JM; Heck, KL				Hill, Jennifer M.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.			Non-consumptive effects of avian predators on fish behavior and cascading indirect interactions in seagrasses	OIKOS			English	Article							BOTTOM-UP FORCES; MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; SHOALGRASS HALODULE-WRIGHTII; TOP-DOWN; TROPHIC CASCADES; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; PREY INTERACTIONS; FIELD EXPERIMENT; FOOD WEBS; ECOSYSTEM CONSEQUENCES	Top-down impacts of avian predators are often overlooked in marine environments despite evidence from other systems that birds significantly impact animal distribution and behavior; instead, birds are typically recognized for the impacts of their nutrient rich guano. This is especially true in shallow seagrass meadows where restoration methods utilize bird perches or stakes to attract birds as a passive fertilizer delivery system that promotes the regrowth of damaged seagrasses. However, this method also increases the local density of avian piscivores that may have multiple unexplored non-consumptive effects on fish behavior and indirect impacts to seagrass communities. We utilized laboratory and field experiments to investigate whether visual cues of avian predators impacted the behavior of the dominant demersal fish in seagrass habitats, the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, and promoted cascading interactions on seagrass-associated fauna and epiphytes. In laboratory mesocosms, pinfish displayed species specific responses to models of avian predators, with herons inducing the greatest avoidance behaviors. Avoidance patterns were confirmed in field seagrass meadows where heron models significantly reduced the number of fish caught in traps. In a long term field experiment, we investigated whether avian predators caused indirect non-consumptive effects on seagrass communities by monitoring fish abundances, invertebrate epiphyte grazers, and the seagrass epiphytes in response to heron models, bird exclusions, and bird stakes. On average, more fish were recovered under bird exclusions and fewer fish under heron models. However, we found no evidence of cascading effects on invertebrate grazers or epiphytes. Bird stake treatments only displayed a simple nutrient effect where higher bird abundances resulted in higher epiphyte biomass. Our results indicate that although birds and their visual cues can affect fish and epiphyte abundance through non-consumptive effects and nutrient enrichment, these impacts do not propagate beyond one trophic level, most likely because of dampening by omnivory and larger scale processes.

Individual variation in ontogenetic niche shifts in habitat use and movement patterns of a large estuarine predator (Carcharhinus leucas)	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Acoustic telemetry; Fast fourier transform; Niche-width expansion; Shark nursery; State-dependent behavior	SIZE-STRUCTURED POPULATIONS; EVERGLADES-NATIONAL-PARK; BULL SHARKS; RESOURCE POLYMORPHISMS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; TOP PREDATOR; FLORIDA; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY; ELASMOBRANCHS	Ontogenetic niche shifts are common among animals, yet most studies only investigate niche shifts at the population level, which may overlook considerable differences among individuals in the timing and dynamics of these shifts. Such divergent behaviors within size-/age-classes have important implications for the roles a population-and specific age-classes-play in their respective ecosystem(s). Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked the movements of juvenile bull sharks in the Shark River Estuary of Everglades National Park, Florida, and found that sharks increased their use of marine microhabitats with age to take advantage of more abundant resources, but continued to use freshwater and estuarine microhabitats as refuges from marine predators. Within this population-level ontogenetic niche shift, however, movement patterns varied among individual sharks, with 47 % of sharks exhibiting condition-dependent habitat use and 53 % appearing risk-averse regardless of body condition. Among sharks older than age 0, fifty percent made regular movements between adjacent regions of the estuary, while the other half made less predictable movements that often featured long-term residence in specific regions. Individual differences were apparently shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including individual responses to food-risk trade-offs and body condition. These differences appear to develop early in the lives of bull sharks, and persist throughout their residencies in nursery habitats. The widespread occurrence of intraspecific variation in behavior among mobile taxa suggests it is important in shaping population dynamics of at least some species, and elucidating the contexts and timing in which it develops and persists is important for understanding its role within communities.

Effects of predators on sea urchin density and habitat use in a southern California kelp forest	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							TOP-DOWN CONTROL; MARINE RESERVE; ROCK LOBSTERS; STRONGYLOCENTROTUS-DROEBACHIENSIS; PARACENTROTUS-LIVIDUS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; JUVENILE ABALONE; SPINY LOBSTERS; PREY REFUGES; CORAL-REEF	Grazing sea urchins can reduce kelp abundance and therefore strongly affect kelp forest community structure. Despite the ecological importance of sea urchins, direct field studies on the role that urchin predators play in shaping urchin populations are rare for southern California. We conducted surveys and manipulative experiments within kelp forests near San Diego, CA, (32-51'28aEuro(3)N, 117-16'00aEuro(3)W) from 2006 to 2009 to determine whether predators such as sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) and spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) may be linked to purple urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and red urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) distribution and habitat use, as well as purple urchin density-dependent mortality. Purple urchins were less dense and more cryptic inside a local marine protected area (MPA) that contained high predator abundance than in nearby heavily fished areas, whereas red urchins rarely were found outside the MPA. Urchin proportional mortality was inversely density dependent during the day when sheephead were active, despite fish aggregations in plots of high urchin density, but was density independent during the night when lobsters were active. Urchin mortality was reduced under understory algal cover during the day, but not during the night. Examining whether urchin mortality from predation is density dependent and how habitat complexity influences this relationship is imperative because behavioral changes and increases in urchin populations can have vast ecological and economic consequences in kelp forest communities.

The size of breeding colonies is a complex trade-off between multiple costs and benefits to an individual's fitness, but the mechanisms by which colony size affects fitness are still poorly understood. One important cost of breeding in a large colony is the spatial constraint in resource use due to the need to regularly return to a central location. Large aggregations, like seabird breeding colonies, may therefore deplete food resources near the colony, forcing individuals to travel farther to find food, which may ultimately limit their reproductive output and population size. This hypothesis, proposed in 1963 by Ashmole for tropical oceanic islands, has so far not been tested at tropical seabird colonies, where food availability is less predictable than in colder waters. We compare the foraging distribution of a common tropical seabird, the masked booby Sula dactylatra, breeding on two islands in the South Atlantic that differ in the size of the breeding seabird community by 2 orders of magnitude, but are surrounded by similar oligotrophic waters. Foraging trips from the island with the smaller colony were on average 221 km (61 %) and 18.0 h (75 %) shorter because birds from the smaller colony rarely spent the night at sea and foraged on average 64 km (46 %) closer to the colony. Energy expenditure was significantly lower, and nest survival higher (47 vs. 37 %, n = 371) on the island with the smaller colony. These results are fully consistent with the predictions from Ashmole's hypothesis and indicate that competition for food around tropical oceanic seabird colonies may indeed be a limiting factor for populations. Identifying important feeding areas for seabirds based on their foraging range may need to account for colony size of both the target and potential competitor species.

Isolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers from a globally distributed marine apex predator, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Tiger shark; Galeocerdo cuvier; Microsatellite; Elasmobranch genetics		High levels of fishing have resulted in declines among many of the oceans top predators, including the globally distributed tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Overexploitation of this species has led to declines in parts of its distribution, which may have important ecological consequences given the tiger shark's trophic position as a large bodied, generalist predator. To assess the population genetics of this species, an enrichment protocol was used to isolate a suite of nine di- and tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci within the tiger shark, which were subsequently characterized using genomic DNA derived from 40 individuals sampled from Hawaiian waters. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 23, and the average expected heterozygosities across loci ranged from 0.30 to 0.93. Analyses suggested a low frequency of null alleles across markers, and all loci conformed to both Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium at P > 0.01.	[Bernard, A. M.; Shivji, M.

Herein we evaluated black-vented (Puffinus opisthomelas), Buller's (P. bulleri), flesh-footed (P. carneipes), pink-footed (P. creatopus), short-tailed (P. tenuirostris), and sooty (P. griseus) shearwaters as fishery-independent indicators of predatory or prey fish availability. We analyzed four years (1996, 2001, 2005, 2008) of monthly (AugustNovember) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration seabird surveys, and United States Geological Survey Pacific Coast Fisheries Database catch, from the California coast to 200 nm offshore. An ordination of shearwater abundance and fish catch revealed that the shearwaters and 11 fish/squid species were significantly correlated with one or more of three principal components, which explained 86% of the variation and revealed distinct species assemblages. We evaluated multiple linear regression models for 19 fisheries using five shearwater metrics: density, aggregation, and behavior (traveling, stationary, feeding), three oceanographic indices, and latitude. Eight of these models had a shearwater metric as the primary predictor. In particular, feeding black-vented shearwater abundance explained 75% of dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) longline catch. This research illustrates the utility of shearwaters as ecosystem indicators, with direct application for predicting fishery catch of commercial importance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Fish assemblage structure was studied over 22 rocky shores with different physical complexity and benthic cover in Ilha Grande Bay, Southeastern Brazil. We aimed to test the relative influences on rocky reef fish assemblage descriptors (richness, density and biomass) of three categories of predictors: 1) biological features as dominant benthic cover (in percentage), i.e., fleshy algae, turf algae and soft coral; 2) physical factors, i.e., depth and a physical structure index; and 3) anthropogenic factors, i.e., distance from the coast, population of the nearest city, and influence of a marine protection area. The main explanatory variables determining fish assemblage structure according to the distance based linear model (DistTLM) were depth (explaining 16.7 % of the variation) and distance from the coast (14.0 %), followed by population of the nearest city (3.7 %) and turf algae (2.9 %). Similarly, fish species richness was positively associated with deeper areas and greater distance from the coast, thus being less accessible to human influence. Fish density and biomass increased with distance from the coast, and this relationship is likely linked to the presence of large top predators and herbivores. Moreover, fish richness and density increased with the physical complexity indicated by the physical structure index, suggesting that the presence of a variety of refuges enhances the availability of shelter. We recommend that areas farthest from the urban centres and with higher physical complexity should be prioritised in conservation policies.

The length, food sources, trophic composition, and energy distribution of benthic food webs in 3 neighboring study areas in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (i.e. Klondike, Burger, and Statoil, 3000 km(2) each) were compared using stable isotope analysis and bomb calorimetry. Food-web length (4 trophic levels), food sources, and plots of delta C-13 versus delta N-15 were comparable among areas. Marked differences in food-web structure were observed when trophic levels in the 3 areas were quantified by benthic biomass and abundance. High proportions of biomass and abundance of trophic level (TL) 3 taxa at Burger were attributed to a large presence of refractory material. High proportions of TL 1 and TL 2 taxa at both Klondike and Statoil reflected higher availability of fresh material. Burger is a rich foraging ground for some benthic top predators due to high benthic prey energy densities. This study demonstrates that marine food webs can vary on small spatial scales with hydrographic conditions, particularly when quantitative trophic level distribution is considered.

Population and individual foraging patterns of two hammerhead sharks using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							SQUID DOSIDICUS-GIGAS; NICHE VARIATION HYPOTHESIS; SCALLOPED HAMMERHEAD; SPHYRNA-LEWINI; SOUTH-AFRICA; ECUADORIAN PACIFIC; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; FEEDING ECOLOGY; DIET; DELTA-N-15	RATIONALE: Individual foraging behavior is an important variable of predators commonly studied at the population level. Some hammerhead shark species play a significant role in the marine ecosystem as top consumers. In this context, stable isotope analysis allows us to infer some ecological metrics and patterns that cannot usually be obtained using traditional methods. METHODS: We determined the isotopic composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15 values) of dorsal muscle and vertebrae of Sphyrna lewini and Sphyrna zygaena using a continuous-flow system consisting of an elemental analyzer combined with a Delta Plus XL mass spectrometer. Foraging variability by sex and by individual was inferred from the isotopic values. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the isotopic values of muscle samples between sexes, but there were differences between species. The trophic niche breadth of the two species was similar and overlap was low. A low niche overlap was observed between S. lewini individual vertebrae. We found differences in the delta N-15 values of S. zygaena vertebrae, with lower values in the first group of samples. CONCLUSIONS: Despite these hammerhead shark species inhabiting the same area, there was low trophic niche overlap between species and individuals, due to different individual foraging strategies, according to the carbon and nitrogen isotopic profiles obtained. The use of tissues that retain lifetime isotopic information is useful to complement studies on trophic ecology. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The surfacing patterns of aquatic air-breathing mammals constitute a behavioral pattern that has evolved as a trade-off between the need to replenish oxygen stores at the surface and the need to conduct other activities underwater. This study aims to better understand the surfacing pattern of a marine top predator, the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), by investigating how their dive duration and surfacing pattern changes across their activity range. Activities were classified into resting, traveling, surface feeding and foraging at depth. For each activity, we classified dives into short and long dives and then estimated the temporal dependence between dive types. We found that minke whales modified their surfacing pattern in an activity-specific manner, both by changing the expression of their dives (i.e. density distribution) and the temporal dependence (transition probability) between dive types. As the depth of the prey layer increased between activities, the surfacing pattern of foraging whales became increasingly structured, going from a pattern dominated by long dives, when feeding at the surface, to a pattern where isolated long dives were followed by an increasing number of breaths (i.e. short dives), when the whale was foraging at depth. A similar shift in surfacing pattern occurred when prey handling time (inferred from surface corralling maneuvers) increased for surface feeding whales. The surfacing pattern also differed between feeding and non-feeding whales. Resting whales did not structure their surfacing pattern, while traveling whales did, possibly as a way to minimize cost of transport. Our results also suggest that minke whales might balance their oxygen level over multiple, rather than single, dive cycles.

The paradox of the pelagics: why bluefin tuna can go hungry in a sea of plenty	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Bluefin tuna; Herring; Optimal foraging; Condition; Thunnus thynnus	COD GADUS-MORHUA; HERRING CLUPEA-HARENGUS; THUNNUS-THYNNUS; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; NORTHWEST ATLANTIC; REGIME SHIFTS; PACIFIC-OCEAN; FISH STOCKS; FORAGE FISH	Large marine predators such as tunas and sharks play an important role in structuring marine food webs. Their future populations depend on the environmental conditions they en counter across life history stages and the level of human exploitation. Standard predator-prey relationships suggest favorable conditions (high prey abundance) should result in successful foraging and reproductive output. Here, we demonstrate that these assumptions are not invariably valid across species, and that somatic condition of Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus in the Gulf of Maine declined in the presence of high prey abundance. We show that the paradox of declining bluefin tuna condition during a period of high prey abundance is explained by a change in the size structure of their prey. Specifically, we identified strong correlations between bluefin tuna body condition, the relative abundance of large Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, and the energetic payoff resulting from consuming different sizes of herring. This correlation is consistent with optimal foraging theory, explaining why bluefin tuna condition suffers even when prey is abundant. Furthermore, optimal foraging principles explain a shift in traditional bluefin tuna foraging areas, toward regions with a higher proportion of large herring. Bluefin tuna appear sensitive to changes in the size spectrum of prey rather than prey abundance, impacting their distribution, reproduction and economic value. Fisheries managers will now face the challenge of how to manage for high abundance of small pelagic fish, which benefits benthic fishes and mammalian predators, and maintain a robust size structure beneficial for top predators with alternative foraging strategies.

The causes of this variability are still debated. Bottom-up processes related to climate variability may strongly affect growth and survival during early life, whereas top-down predator effects may be a major source of juvenile mortality. Moreover, intrinsic density-dependent processes, which have received much less attention, are hypothetically responsible for the cycles in recruitment. This study explored how climate, larval production, intercohort cannibalism and groundfish predation may have affected recruitment of early juvenile snow crab in the northwest Gulf of St Lawrence (eastern Canada) over a period of 23 years. Abundance of early juvenile snow crabs (2.5-22.9 mm in carapace width), representing the first 3 years of benthic life, came from an annual trawl survey and was used to determine cohort strength. Analyses revealed a cyclic pattern in abundance of 0(+) crabs that may arise from cohort resonant effects. This pattern consisted of three recruitment pulses but was reduced to two pulses by age 2(+), while the interannual variability of cohort strength was dampened. This reconfiguration of the earliest recruitment pattern was dictated primarily by bottom water temperature and cannibalism, which progressively overruled the pre-settlement factors of larval production and surface water temperature that best explained abundance of 0(+) crabs. The results strongly suggest that bottom-up and density-dependent processes prevail over top-down control in setting the long-term trends and higher-frequency oscillations of snow crab early recruitment patterns.

In particular, fisheries-targeting forage fish (small and abundant pelagic fish) might have a detrimental effect on fisheries-targeting predators that consume them. However, complexities in ecological interactions might dampen, negate, or even reverse this trade-off, because small pelagic fish can be important predators on egg stages of piscivorous fish. Further, the strength of this trade-off might depend on the extent to which piscivorous fish targeted by fisheries regulate forage species productivity. Here, we developed a novel delay-differential bioeconomic model of predator-prey and fishing dynamics to quantify how much egg predation or weak top-town control affects the strength of trade-off between forage and piscivore fisheries, and to measure how ecological interactions dictate policies that maximize steady-state profits. We parameterized the model based on ecological and economic data from the North Sea Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). The optimal policy was very sensitive to the ecological interactions (either egg predation or weak top-down control of forage by predators) at relatively low forage prices but was less sensitive at high forage fish prices. However, the optimal equilibrium harvest rates on forage and piscivores were not substantially different from what might be derived through analyses that did not consider species interactions. Applying the optimal multispecies policy would produce substantial losses (>25%) in profits in the piscivore fishery, and the extent of loss was sensitive to ecological scenarios. While our equilibrium analysis is informative, a dynamic analysis under similar ecological scenarios is necessary to reveal the full economic and ecological benefits of applying ecosystem-based fishery management policies to predator-prey fishery systems.

This behavior ignores taxonomic preferences shown by the predators and the capacity of some zooplankton to actively select or reject individual prey items from mixtures. We carried out two model experiments comparing impacts of zooplankton displaying passive and active selection, which resulted in contrasting dynamics for the pelagic system. Passive selection by the grazer resulted in a top down control on the prey with a fast turn-over of nutrients. Active selection, on the other hand led to a bottom-up control, with slower nutrient turnover constraining primary production by changing the system toward export of particulate matter. Our results suggest that selective feeding behavior is an important trait, and should be considered alongside size and taxonomy when studying the role of zooplankton impact in the ecosystem.

Theory suggests such complexity can be simplified by focusing on processes sharing the same scale as the pattern of interest. This scale-dependent approach to studying communities has been challenged by multiscale meta-ecosystem theory, which recognizes that systems are interconnected by the movement of "ecological subsidies" and suggests that cross-scale feedbacks between local and regional processes can be equally important for understanding community structure. We reconcile these two perspectives by developing and testing a hierarchical meta-ecosystem model. The model predicts local community responses to connectivity over multiple oceanographic spatial scales, defined as macro- (100s of km), meso- (10s of km), and local scale (100s of m). It assumes that local communities occur in distinct regions and that connectivity effects are strongest among local sites. Predictions are that if macroscale processes dominate, then regardless of mesoscale differences, (1) local communities will be similar, and (2) will be even more so with increased connectivity. With dominance of mesoscale (i.e., regional) processes, (3) local structure will be similar within but distinct between regions, and (4) with increased connectivity similar both within and among regions. With dominance of local-scale processes, (5) local communities will differ both within and among regions, and (6) with increased connectivity be similar within but not between regions. We tested the model by evaluating rocky intertidal community structure patterns with variation in ecological subsidies and environmental conditions at 13 sites spanning 725 km of the northern California Current system. External factors operating at meso- and local scales had strong effects, explaining 52% and 27% of the variance, respectively, in community structure. Sessile invertebrate and predator dominance was associated with weaker upwelling, higher phytoplankton abundance, and higher recruitment, and the opposite was true for macrophyte dominance. Overall, our results support the theory that meta-ecosystems are organized hierarchically, with environmental processes dominating at meso- to macroscales and ecological processes playing a more important role at local scales, but with important bidirectional cross-scale interactions.

Here we report a recent extreme event in sea ice conditions in East Antarctica and investigate its consequences on a seabird community. In early 2014, the Dumont d'Urville Sea experienced the highest magnitude sea ice cover (76.8%) event on record (1982-2013: range 11.3-65.3%; mean +/- 95% confidence interval: 27.7% (23.1-32.2%)). Catastrophic effects were detected in the breeding output of all sympatric seabird species, with a total failure for two species. These results provide a new view crucial to predictive models of species abundance and distribution as to how extreme sea ice events might impact an entire community of top predators in polar marine ecosystems in a context of expanding sea ice in eastern Antarctica.

The fin whale, a marine top consumer, exposes strengths and weaknesses of the use of fluoride as ecological tracer	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Fluoride; Balaenoptera physalus; Bone; Euphasiids; Tracer	SALMON SALMO-SALAR; BALAENOPTERA-PHYSALUS; MEGANYCTIPHANES-NORVEGICA; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; ANTARCTIC KRILL; STABLE-ISOTOPES; VOLCANIC ASH; HEAVY-METALS; BONE; FLUOROSIS	Fluoride is retained in bone tissues of animals and its availability in the environment varies between regions according to natural and anthropogenic sources. These properties suggest this element as a suitable tracer of origin, distribution or movements of animals. In marine environments, krill builds-up fluoride concentrations that are transferred to its predators. In this study we examine the ability of bone fluoride concentrations to discriminate two separate populations of a krill consumer, the fin whale. Background levels of the sampling areas (Western Iceland and North-Western Spain) were determined through the analysis of krill samples. As expected, due to the high load of volcanic-derived fluoride in Icelandic waters, krill from W Iceland showed much higher fluoride concentrations than that from NW Spain. Concentrations in whales' bone were correlated with sex and age, increasing linearly with age in females and showing significantly lower values and a different age-related pattern of accumulation in males. Fluoride concentrations in whales' bone were much higher than in krill, indicating accumulation of the element but, rather unexpectedly, the area of origin had no influence on concentrations. This apparent contradiction may be explained either by the integration in bone of food consumed in other areas, or by the activation of homeostatic responses at very high levels of fluoride exposure. It is concluded that fluoride can be a useful tracer only if age and sex data are integrated into the analysis, year-round information on diet is available and/or the investigated population is exposed to mild levels of this element.

Therefore, we have developed a spatial-temporal food web model of the global ocean, spanning from primary producers through to top predators and fisheries. Through this, we aim to evaluate how alternative management actions may impact the supply of seafood for future generations. LocationGlobal ocean. MethodsWe developed a modelling complex to initially predict the combined impact of environmental parameters and fisheries on global seafood production, and initially evaluated the model's performance through hindcasting. The modelling complex has a food web model as core, obtains environmental productivity from a biogeochemical model and assigns global fishing effort spatially. We tuned model parameters based on Markov chain random walk stock reduction analysis, fitting the model to historic catches. We evaluated the goodness-of-fit of the model to data for major functional groups, by spatial management units and globally. ResultsThis model is the most detailed ever constructed of global fisheries, and it was able to replicate broad patterns of historic fisheries catches with best agreement for the total catches and good agreement for species groups, with more variation at the regional level. Main conclusionsWe have developed a modelling complex that can be used for evaluating the combined impact of fisheries and climate change on upper-trophic level organisms in the global ocean, including invertebrates, fish and other large vertebrates. The model provides an important step that will allow global-scale evaluation of how alternative fisheries management measures can be used for mitigation of climate change.

Working under the overall hypothesis that, as fishing pressure increases, the abundance in upper trophic levels decreases followed by intermediate levels, we develop an index that characterizes the comparative health of rocky reefs. Using underwater visual transects to sample rocky reefs in the Gulf of California, Mexico, we sampled 147 reefs across 1200 km to test this reef health index (IRH). Five-indicators described 88% of the variation among the reefs along this fishing-intensity gradient: the biomass of piscivores and carnivores were positively associated with reef health; while the relative abundances of zooplanktivores, sea stars, and sea urchins, were negatively correlated with degraded reefs health. The average size of commercial macro-invertebrates and the absolute fish biomass increased significantly with increasing values of the IRE. Higher total fish biomass was found on reefs with complex geomorphology compared to reefs with simple geomorphology (r(2) = 0.14, F = 44.05, P<0.0001) and the trophic biomass pyramid also changed, which supports the evidence of the inversion of biomass pyramids along the gradient of reefs' health. Our findings introduce a novel approach to classify the health of rocky reefs under different fishing regimes and therefore resultant community structures. Additionally, our IRH provides insight regarding the potential gains in total fish biomass that may result from the conservation and protection of reefs with more complex geomorphology.

Indirect effects of overfishing on Caribbean reefs: sponges overgrow reef-building corals	PEERJ			English	Article						Food webs; Trophic cascades; Indirect effects; Resource trade-offs; Chemical defense; Top-down control; Spatial competition; Coral reefs; MPAs; Marine protected areas	RESOURCE TRADE-OFF; CHEMICAL DEFENSES; MACROALGAL COMMUNITIES; TROPHIC CASCADE; ECOLOGY; ECOSYSTEM; GROWTH; HERBIVORY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	Consumer-mediated indirect effects at the community level are difficult to demonstrate empirically. Here, we show an explicit indirect effect of overfishing on competition between sponges and reef-building corals from surveys of 69 sites across the Caribbean. Leveraging the large-scale, long-term removal of sponge predators, we selected overfished sites where intensive methods, primarily fish-trapping, have been employed for decades or more, and compared them to sites in remote or marine protected areas (MPAs) with variable levels of enforcement. Sponge-eating fishes (angelfishes and parrotfishes) were counted at each site, and the benthos surveyed, with coral colonies scored for interaction with sponges. Overfished sites had >3 fold more overgrowth of corals by sponges, and mean coral contact with sponges was 25.6%, compared with 12.0% at less-fished sites. Greater contact with corals by sponges at overfished sites was mostly by sponge species palatable to sponge predators. Palatable species have faster rates of growth or reproduction than defended sponge species, which instead make metabolically expensive chemical defenses. These results validate the top-down conceptual model of sponge community ecology for Caribbean reefs, as well as provide an unambiguous justification for MPAs to protect threatened reef-building corals. An unanticipated outcome of the benthic survey component of this study was that overfished sites had lower mean macroalgal cover (23.1% vs. 38.1% for less-fished sites), a result that is contrary to prevailing assumptions about seaweed control by herbivorous fishes. Because we did not quantify herbivores for this study, we interpret this result with caution, but suggest that additional large-scale studies comparing intensively overfished and MPA sites are warranted to examine the relative impacts of herbivorous fishes and urchins on Caribbean reefs.

We examined the diet and foraging dynamics of breeding macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus from sub-Antarctic Heard Island and related these to prey distributions derived from active-acoustics and net-derived data in the foraging zone of the penguins. Consistent with previous findings, we found that penguin diets changed between the guard and creche stages of the breeding cycle and that this change in diet corresponded with a switch from short foraging trips in the guard stage to significantly longer, offshore foraging trips in the creche stage. We related these differences in diet and foraging to characteristics of the prey field-specifically, a relatively uniform distribution of krill over the shelf and in deeper, offshore waters, compared with an increasing abundance of fish further from shore. We developed a simple dynamic energy budget for macaroni penguins to explore whether targeting fish during the creche stage was an energetically favourable strategy. Finally, we extrapolated our energy budget to estimate prey consumption at the colony scale as previous work has suggested that depletion near breeding colonies could contribute to prey switching. We found that prey switching during the creche stage was energetically favourable and was most likely related to a reduction in foraging constraints, rather than prey depletion. This study shows the value of integrating data sets to address questions surrounding variation in diet and the use of alternative prey by marine predators.

Here, we provide a state-of-the-art review of the use of SIA for assessing anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems, in order to establish current knowledge gaps and identify promising applications for evaluating the ecological status of marine coastal waters. Specifically, the potential of SIA to provide food web-scale indicators for estimating cumulative anthropogenic pressures is addressed. The review indicates that the methodology has been used for virtually the whole spectrum of human pressures known to influence marine ecosystems. However, only the effects of chemical pollution, release of dissolved and particulate nutrients, and invasive species have been extensively investigated. For the first two pressures, substantial efforts have been made to implement isotopic quantitative approaches and metrics for inter-system comparisons; however, with the exception of nutrient release, the majority of aquatic studies have been carried out in freshwater systems, and only limited information is available on marine environments. In particular, the effects of invasive species on coastal habitats have received scant attention. Trophic position of indicator species emerges as the isotopic metric most ubiquitously adopted for measuring the impact of anthropogenic pressures. Conversely, the application of other recently implemented metrics, proven to be highly effective in integrating information on the spatial-temporal dynamics of aquatic food webs, is to date still limited. The potential of stable isotope analysis to provide a unifying methodological-theoretical framework for effective, inter-ecosystem comparisons of both single and multiple anthropogenic pressures is emphasised. Additionally, a plea for the implementation and intercalibration of community-scale isotopic metrics is made, in order to provide useful tools and indicators for current and future environmental legislative initiatives.

We examined how top-down and bottom-up interactions may mediate knock-on effects of a coastal deposit-feeding clam, Macomona liliana (hereafter Macomona), on sandflat meiobenthos densities. Therefore we manipulated densities of Macomona in combination with predator exclusion and experimental shading that was expected to alter microphytobenthos biomass. We show that Macomona regulated densities of meiobenthic (38-500 mu m) nematodes, copepods, polychaetes, turbellarians, and ostracodes during the three months of incubation via indirect mechanisms. Predator pressure on Macomona by eagle rays (Myliobatis tenuicaudatus) was found to have a negative effect on densities of some meiobenthic taxa. Furthermore, experimental shading resulted in the loss of a positive relation between Macomona and microphytobenthos biomass, while concurrently increasing the density of some meiobenthic taxa. We suggest that this observation can be explained by the release from bioturbation interference effects of the cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi that was found to thrive in the presence of Macomona under non-shaded conditions. Our results highlight the importance of interactions between macrofaunal bioturbation, microphyte biomass, sediment stability, and predation pressure for the structuring of benthic communities. This experiment illustrates that manipulative field experiments may be particularly suitable to study such multiple indirect mechanisms that regulate ecosystem diversity and related functioning because such approaches may best capture the complex feedbacks and processes that determine ecosystem dynamics.

One way in which to examine these processes is to study the secondary effects of predator removal on communities. This study examined the role of predatory fishes in structuring communities of coral reef fishes, by using a network of marine reserves (the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park) as a natural experiment. We hypothesized that reefs with high densities of piscivores (marine reserves) would have distinct fish communities from those where piscivores have been depleted through fishing, due to variation in predation pressure. We predicted that predator depletion would result in "prey release'', and a corresponding increase in prey densities along a gradient of fishing intensity, causing a change in the community composition of reef fishes. To address this, fish counts and habitat surveys were conducted at four locations on the Great Barrier Reef. At each location, comparisons were made amongst three marine park zones that varied in their exposure to fishing practices; no-take marine reserves, limited fishing areas, and open fishing areas. The density and biomass of predators varied consistently among zones at each location. Furthermore, we found strong evidence for prey release at all four locations, resulting in distinct fish assemblages amongst zones. Reefs open to fishing had much lower densities of piscivores, and higher densities of prey and herbivorous fishes compared to marine reserves. This broad pattern was consistent amongst locations, and persisted at the level of species, trophic groups, families and communities. Habitat characteristics did not vary significantly amongst zones in a consistent manner amongst locations. Although habitat relationships were strong for specialist species such as butterflyfishes, densities of predators were stronger predictors of prey density for most species, and the trophic composition of reef fish communities differed significantly amongst zones at all locations. Results from this study support the concept that top-down effects can be strong divers of prey populations and influence community structure in highly diverse systems. These data emphasize the vital role of predators, and reinforce the importance of preserving and restoring top-down trophic interactions in ecological systems.	[Boaden, A.

Influence of artificial food provisioning from fisheries on killer whale reproductive output	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						demography; depredation; fisheries; food provisioning; killer whale; longlines; reproduction; top predator	ORCINUS-ORCA; CROZET ARCHIPELAGO; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; SPERM-WHALES; DEMOGRAPHY; PREY; CONSEQUENCES; POPULATIONS; VARIANCE	Prey availability is a critical factor influencing demographic trajectories of long-lived, top predators, which may therefore be strongly affected by artificial food provisioning. In the Crozet archipelago, killer whales feed on a wide range of species including birds, marine mammals and fish. Following the development of the Patagonian toothfish fisheries in 1996, killer whales began to also depredate longlines. Social groups, hereafter referred to as matrilines, exhibited different levels of interaction; some were involved in most of the depredation events, while others were never observed interacting with fisheries. These differences in interaction levels influenced reproduction. An extensive photo-identification effort from 2003 to 2012 allowed us to estimate the probability of calving for 21 reproductive females. Using multi-model inference, we found a positive effect of depredation on female calving rate. These results suggest an effect of artificial food provisioning on female reproductive output with potentially far-reaching consequences on the demography of the Crozet killer whale population. Our findings evidence the need to account for both intra-population heterogeneity and level of interaction with fisheries when assessing conservation strategies of long-lived marine predators involved in similar depredation worldwide.

What Can Stable Isotope Analysis of Top Predator Tissues Contribute to Monitoring of Tundra Ecosystems?

Indicator species have been proposed as useful tools, and predators and their diet may be particularly suitable. The vast and remote arctic tundra represents a good case study as shifts in ecosystem states are presently occurring, and monitoring is a major challenge. Here we assess what stable isotopes reflecting the diet of the arctic fox, a widespread and highly flexible top predator, can contribute to effective monitoring of the vertebrate prey basis of Arctic tundra. We used data collected over 2-5 years from six sites in the Eurasian Arctic and Greenland. Stable isotope signatures of arctic fox winter fur reflected both spatial and temporal variability in the composition of the vertebrate prey basis. Clear contrasts were apparent in the importance of marine resources, as well as of small rodents and their multiannual density fluctuations. Some important resources could however not be separated because of confounding isotopic signatures. Moreover, except for preferred prey, the proportions of prey in the diet may not necessarily reflect the relative importance of species in the community of available prey. Knowing these limitations, we suggest that the arctic fox diet as inferred from stable isotopes could serve as one of several key targets in ecosystem-based monitoring programs.

In a management context, it is critically important to clarify the role apex predators play in structuring populations of lower trophic levels. Thus, we examined the top-down influence of reef sharks (an apex predator on coral reefs) and mesopredators on large-bodied herbivores. We measured the abundance, size structure, and biomass of apex predators, mesopredators, and herbivores across fished, no-take, and no-entry management zones in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Shark abundance and mesopredator size and biomass were higher in no-entry zones than in fished and no-take zones, which indicates the viability of strictly enforced human exclusion areas as tools for the conservation of predator communities. Changes in predator populations due to protection in no-entry zones did not have a discernible influence on the density, size, or biomass of different functional groups of herbivorous fishes. The lack of a relationship between predators and herbivores suggests that top-down forces may not play a strong role in regulating large-bodied herbivorous coral reef fish populations. Given this inconsistency with traditional ecological theories of trophic cascades, trophic structures on coral reefs may need to be reassessed to enable the establishment of appropriate and effective management regimes.
