Sustained impairment of respiratory function and swim performance following acute oil exposure in a coastal marine fish	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Oil spill; Recovery; Swimming; Aerobic scope; Predator	MAHI CORYPHAENA-HIPPURUS; DRUM SCIAENOPS-OCELLATUS; CORAL-REEF FISH; GULF-OF-MEXICO; CRUDE-OIL; RED DRUM; OCEAN; DAMSELFISHES; RESPIROMETRY; TOXICITY	Acute exposure to crude oil polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can severely impair cardiorespiratory function and swim performance of larval fish; however, the effects of acute oil exposure on later life stages and the capacity for subsequent recovery is less clear. Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) is an economically important apex predator native to the Gulf of Mexico, which was directly exposed to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon (DWH) oil spill. Here we examine impact and recovery of young adult red drum from exposure to concentrations of 0, 4.1, and 12.1 mu gL(-1) Sigma PAH(50) naturally weathered oil-water accommodated fractions (geometric mean), which are well within the range of concentrations measured during the DWH incident. We focused on aerobic scope (ASc), burst-and critical swimming speeds (U-burst and U-crit), cost of transport (COT), as well as the capacity to repay oxygen debt following exhaustive exercise (EPOC), which are critical parameters for success of all life stages of fishes. A 24 h acute exposure to 4.1 mu gL(-1) Sigma PAH caused a significant 9.7 and 12.6% reduction of U-burst and U-crit respectively, but no change in ASc, COT or EPOC, highlighting a decoupled effect on the respiratory and swimming systems. A higher exposure concentration, 12.1 mu gL(-1) Sigma PAH, caused an 8.6 and 8.4% impairment of U-burst and U-crit, as well as an 18.4% reduction in ASc. These impairments persisted six weeks post-exposure, suggesting that recorded impacts are entrenched. Large predatory fishes are critically dependent on the cardiorespiratory and swimming systems for ecological fitness, and long-term impairment of performance due to acute oil exposure suggests that even acute exposure events may have long lasting impacts on the ecological fitness of affected populations.

The distribution of persistent organic pollutants in a trophically complex Antarctic ecosystem model	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Climate change; Persistent organic pollutants (POPS); Marine chemistry; Polar chemistry	AQUATIC FOOD-WEBS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; FUNCTIONAL TYPE MODELS; ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS; PCB BIOACCUMULATION; HUMPBACK WHALES; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIME TRENDS; SEAWATER	Despite Antarctica's isolation from human population centres, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are transported there via long range atmospheric transport and subsequently cold-trapped. The challenging nature of working in the Antarctic environment greatly limits our ability to monitor POP concentrations and understand the processes that govern the distribution of POPs in Antarctic ecosystems. Here we couple a dynamic, trophically complex biological model with a fugacity model to investigate the distribution of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in a near-shore Antarctic ecosystem. Using this model we examine the steady-state, and annual cycle of HCB concentration in the atmosphere, ocean, sediment, detritus, and 21 classes of biota that span from primary producers to apex predators. The scope and trophic resolution of our model allows us to examine POP pathways through the ecosystem. In our model the main pathway of HCB to upper trophic species is via pelagic communities, with relatively little via benthic communities. Using a dynamic ecosystem model also allows us to examine the seasonal and potential climate change induced changes in POP distribution. We show that there is a large annual cycle in concentration in the planktonic communities, which may have implications for biomagnification factors calculated from observations. We also examine the direct effects of increasing temperature on the redistribution of HCB in a changing climate and find that it is likely minor compared to other indirect effects, such as changes in atmospheric circulation, sea ice dynamics, and changes to the ecosystem itself.

Assessing risk of estuarine ecosystem collapse	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Biodiversity assessment; Threatening processes; Risk assessment; IUCN Red list of ecosystems; Habitat mosaic	SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION; LOWER CHESAPEAKE BAY; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; WATER-QUALITY; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; HABITAT LOSS; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; BETA-DIVERSITY	Estuarine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by coastal development and climate change. The large number of estuaries globally necessitates risk assessment to prioritise conservation efforts. Schemes for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse have been designed around terrestrial ecosystems, often defined by a single characteristic vegetation type, with their applicability to estuaries unclear. Here we consider the causes and symptoms of estuarine ecosystem collapse and assess, using a case study of the Chesapeake Bay, the applicability of ecosystem-level risk assessments to estuarine ecosystems, typified by mosaics of habitats. Functional estuaries are characterised by habitat heterogeneity and connectivity, maintenance of constituent habitats through recruitment, and a complex trophic structure including apex predators. Additionally, primary production and biomass are dominated by benthic, as opposed to pelagic, species. Hence, homogenisation of habitat types, decreased connectivity, recruitment failure, loss of apex predators and a decreased ratio of benthic to pelagic biomass may be symptoms of a trajectory towards collapse. In terrestrial ecosystems, criteria used for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse include declining or restricted distribution of ecosystems, degradation of the abiotic environment, changes in species composition and declining ecological function. As the boundaries of estuaries are typically defined by topography, rarely do significant changes in the area of the ecosystem occur. Furthermore, because the extent of estuaries is typically small, assessments based on area of occupancy may over-inflate risk. Instead, criteria based on abiotic and biotic changes, many of which are documented through monitoring programs, may be most useful for risk assessments of estuarine ecosystems.

Diet and condition of mesopredators on coral reefs in relation to shark abundance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS; BODY-SIZE; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS; TROPHIC CASCADES; APEX PREDATORS; HABITAT USE; RISK; FISH; GROWTH	Reef sharks may influence the foraging behaviour of mesopredatory teleosts on coral reefs via both risk effects and competitive exclusion. We used a "natural experiment" to test the hypothesis that the loss of sharks on coral reefs can influence the diet and body condition of mesopredatory fishes by comparing two remote, atoll-like reef systems, the Rowley Shoals and the Scott Reefs, in northwestern Australia. The Rowley Shoals are a marine reserve where sharks are abundant, whereas at the Scott Reefs numbers of sharks have been reduced by centuries of targeted fishing. On reefs where sharks were rare, the gut contents of five species of mesopredatory teleosts largely contained fish while on reefs with abundant sharks, the same mesopredatory species consumed a larger proportion of benthic invertebrates. These measures of diet were correlated with changes in body condition, such that the condition of mesopredatory teleosts was significantly poorer on reefs with higher shark abundance. Condition was defined as body weight, height and width for a given length and also estimated via several indices of condition. Due to the nature of natural experiments, alternative explanations cannot be discounted. However, the results were consistent with the hypothesis that loss of sharks may influence the diet and condition of mesopredators and by association, their fecundity and trophic role. Regardless of the mechanism (risk effects, competitive release, or other), our findings suggest that overfishing of sharks has the potential to trigger trophic cascades on coral reefs and that further declines in shark populations globally should be prevented to protect ecosystem health.

The events resulted in regime shifts cascading through all trophic levels, disturbing ecosystem functioning and damaging the water environment. Causal pathways by which the external (hydroclimate, overfishing) and internal (food web interactions) drivers provoke regime shifts are investigated. Statistical data analyses supported by an interpretative framework based on hierarchical ecosystem theory revealed mechanisms of hierarchical incorporation of environmental factors into the ecosystem. Evidence links Atlantic teleconnections to Black Sea hydroclimate, which together with fishing shapes variability in fish stocks. The hydroclimatic signal is conveyed through the food web via changes in productivity at all levels, to planktivorous fish. Fluctuating fish abundance is believed to induce a lagged change in competitor jelly plankton that cascades down to phytoplankton and influences water quality. Deprived of the stabilising role of apex predators, the Black Sea's hierarchical ecosystem organisation is susceptible to both environmental and anthropogenic stresses, and increased fishing makes fish stock collapses highly probable. When declining stocks are confronted with burgeoning fishing effort associated with the inability of fishery managers and decision-makers to adapt rapidly to changes in fish abundance, there is overfishing and stock collapse. Management procedures are ineffective at handling complex phenomena such as ecosystem regime shifts because of the shortage of suitable explanatory models. The proposed concepts and models reported here relate the hydroclimate, overfishing and invasive species to shifts in ecosystem functioning and water quality, unravelling issues such as the causality of ecosystem interactions and mechanisms and offering potential for finding ways to reverse regime shifts. We advocate a management approach aiming at restoring ecosystem hierarchy that might mitigate the costly consequences of regime shifts.

Bioaccumulation and biomagnification of mercury and methylmercury in four sympatric coastal sharks in a protected subtropical lagoon	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Apex predators; Sharks; Florida Bay; Mercury; Stable isotopes; Trophic transfer	STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; CARBON ISOTOPES; ATLANTIC-OCEAN; FLORIDA BAY; FISH; TISSUES; DELTA-C-13; DIET; SEA	Mercury bioaccumulation is frequently observed in marine ecosystems, often with stronger effects at higher trophic levels. We compared total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) from muscle with length, comparative isotopic niche, and diet (via delta C-13 and delta N-15) among four sympatric coastal sharks in Florida Bay (USA): blacknose, blacktip, bull, and lemon. Mercury in blacknose and blacktip sharks increased significantly with size, whereas bull and lemon sharks had a high variance in mercury relative to size. Both delta C-13 and delta N-15 were consistent with general resource use and trophic position relationships across all species. A significant relationship was observed between delta C-13 and mercury in blacktip sharks, suggesting an ontogenetic shift isotopic niche, possibly a dietary change. Multiple regression showed that delta C-13 and delta N-15 were the strongest factors regarding mercury bioaccumulation in individuals across all species. Additional research is recommended to resolve the mechanisms that determine mercury biomagnification in individual shark species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we report a new onychodontiform (Osteichthyes, Sarcopterygii) Onychodus eriensis n. sp. from the Dundee Formation (Eifelian-Givetian boundary, 390-387 Ma) of southwestern Ontario represented by two wellpreserved onychodontiform lower jaws. The most complete specimen consists of a large (28 cm), well-preserved right jaw with most of the dentition present. The dentary has 50 teeth, not including the parasymphysial tusk whorl, which is poorly preserved but consists of at least three tusks. The anteriormost teeth of the dentary are also not complete, but the second dentary tooth is notably procurved. The posterior teeth are conical and approximately equal in size for much of the length of the tooth row. Onychodus eriensis n. sp. differs from the closely related contemporary species Onychodus sigmoides and all other onychodonts in that it has a strong dorsal curvature of the anterior dentary ramus and marked anterior expansion of the dentary. An expanded phylogenetic analysis of Devonian onychodontiforms suggests that O. eriensis is closely related to Onychodus jandamarrai. The new material indicates that Onychodontiformes is more diverse than previously recognized, and that further analysis of vertebrate remains from southwestern Ontario will lead to additional insights into the diversity of Devonian sarcopterygians.

Here we describe significant trophic cascades in an open coastal planktonic ecosystem exposed to an introduced top predator. The ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was monitored for an 8-year period concurrent with measures of the food web structure of the plankton and strong trophic cascades were evident. In the 5 years when M. leidyi were found, their target prey (grazing copepods) were reduced 5-fold and the primary producers doubled their biomass when released from the grazing pressure. The increased phytoplankton biomass could unequivocally be assigned to grazing release since concurrent measurements of primary production did not differ between years with or without M. leidyi. Copepod biomass prior to the mass occurrence of the ctenophore was important. The years without M. leidyi had significantly higher biomass of copepods in July, the month preceding the outburst of the ctenophore. The profound changes of the pelagic ecosystem faced with a non-selective apex predator shows that marine communities are not exceptions from trophic cascade mechanisms.

The bitten material includes skull remains referred to small-sized baleen whales as well as fragmentary cetacean and pinniped postcrania. These occurrences, the first in their kind from the Southern Hemisphere, significantly expand the still scarce record of bite marks for C. megalodon; moreover, for the first time a prey (or scavenging item) of C megalodon is identified at the species level (as Piscobalaena nana, a diminutive member of the extinct mysticete family Cetotheriidae). Due to the fragmentary nature of the studied material, the exact origin of the detected marks (i.e., by scavenging or by active predation) cannot be ascertained. Nevertheless, relying on actualistic observations and size-based considerations, we propose that diminutive mysticetes (e.g., cetotheriids) were some of the target prey of adult C megalodon, at least along the coast of present-day Peru. C. megalodon is thus here interpreted as an apex predator whose trophic spectrum was focused on relatively small-sized prey. Lastly, we propose a link between the recent collapse of various lineages of diminutive mysticetes (observed around 3 Ma) and the extinction of C megalodon (occurring around the end of the Pliocene).

Species diversity, abundance, biomass, size and trophic structure of fish on coral reefs in relation to shark abundance	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Apex predator; Mesopredators; Herbivores; Food web; Lethal effects; Ecosystems; Natural experiments	BODY-SIZE; CARCHARHINUS-AMBLYRHYNCHOS; COMMUNITIES; CASCADES; ISLANDS; CONNECTIVITY; ASSEMBLAGES; ECOSYSTEMS; PROTECTION; PREDATORS	Theory predicts that loss of gape-limited sharks should lead to increases in the abundance and biomass of smaller size classes of prey. We used stereo-baited remote underwater video stations (stereo-BRUVS) and stereo diver-operated video systems (stereo-DOVS) to characterise the shark and fish assemblages on 2 remote, atoll-like reef systems in northwestern Australia, the Rowley Shoals and the Scott Reefs. Whereas the Rowley Shoals is a marine protected area, sharks have been removed from the Scott Reefs for over 3 centuries. We found that sharks were significantly more diverse, more abundant, larger in size and greater in biomass in the marine reserve relative to the Scott Reefs. Consistent with a priori hypotheses, bony fishes displayed greater species diversity, abundance and biomass where sharks were common relative to the predator-depleted location. The size and trophic structure of bony fish assemblages also differed between locations. Our results provide large-scale evidence consistent with the hypothesis that reef-associated sharks are gape-limited trophic omnivores that impose top-down effects on medium sized (<50 cm), low- to mid-trophic level fishes. On stereo-BRUVS, for example, prey in the 0 to 29.99 cm size class had 203% more biomass at the predator-depleted reef relative to the location where sharks were abundant. As body size is an important determinant of ecological role and fitness in fishes, these findings suggest that the rapid and ongoing loss of sharks from reefs globally may have important implications for reef management and investigations into the effect of fishing on reef systems.

Holocene changes in the trophic ecology of an apex marine predator in the South Atlantic Ocean	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Fur seals; Arctocephalus australis; Historical ecology; Hunter-gatherers; Sealing; Environmental changes; Stable isotopes	DENSITY-DEPENDENT GROWTH; STABLE-ISOTOPE RATIOS; NORTHERN FUR SEALS; SHIFTING BASE-LINE; BONE-COLLAGEN; ARCTOCEPHALUS-AUSTRALIS; NITROGEN ISOTOPES; MIDDLE HOLOCENE; LATE QUATERNARY; FOOD-CHAINS	Predators may modify their diets as a result of both anthropogenic and natural environmental changes. Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen and carbon in bone collagen have been used to reconstruct the foraging ecology of South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) in the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean since the Middle Holocene, a region inhabited by hunter-gatherers by millennia and modified by two centuries of whaling, sealing and fishing. Results suggest that the isotopic niche of fur seals from Patagonia has not changed over the last two millennia (average for the period: delta C-13(2200-0BP) = -13.4 +/- 0.5aEuro degrees, delta N-15(2200-0BP) = 20.6 +/- 1.1aEuro degrees). Conversely, Middle Holocene fur seals fed more pelagically than their modern conspecifics in the Rio de la Plata region (delta C-13(7000BP) = -15.9 +/- 0.6aEuro degrees vs. delta C-13(PRESENT) = -13.5 +/- 0.8aEuro degrees) and Tierra del Fuego (delta C-13(6400-4300BP) = -15.4 +/- 0.5aEuro degrees vs. delta C-13(PRESENT) = -13.2 +/- 0.7aEuro degrees). In the latter region, Middle Holocene fur seals also fed at a higher trophic level than their modern counterparts (delta N-15(6400-4300BP) = 20.5 +/- 0.5aEuro degrees vs. delta N-15(PRESENT) = 19.0 +/- 1.6aEuro degrees). Nevertheless, a major dietary shift was observed in fur seals from Tierra del Fuego during the nineteenth century (delta C-13(100BP) = -17.2 +/- 0.3aEuro degrees, delta N-15(100BP) = 18.6 +/- 0.7aEuro degrees), when marine primary productivity plummeted and the fur seal population was decimated by sealing. Disentangling the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic factors in explaining this dietary shift is difficult, but certainly the trophic position of fur seals has changed through the Holocene in some South Atlantic regions.

These changes are spreading throughout the entire food web, affecting apex predators such as seabirds. brunnich's guillemot Uria lomvia populations in Svalbard archipelago have significantly declined since the mid-1990s. For longlived species such as seabirds, population growth rate is highly sensitive to changes in adult survival rates, and slight changes in survival may have large consequences at the population level. Adult survival rates, were estimated for Brunnich's guillemots individually marked and monitored from 1986 to 2011 at Bjornoya, Svalbard. While survival appeared to be repeatedly high (mean +/- SE; 95 +/- 1%) from 1986 to 1995-98 (transitional years, when Svalbard guillemot colonies started to decline), it dropped by 9-12% over the period 1995-98 to 2011. This decline coincided with the occurrence of an abrupt ecosystem shift in the North Atlantic Ocean in the mid-1990s and the weakening of the Atlantic subpolar gyre. Variations in the subpolar gyre index (SGI) were significantly associated with inter-annual variation in guillemot annual survival, and a strong gyre (i.e. cold waters on guillemot wintering grounds) was associated with high adult survival. Our results, combined with other studies, suggest that the SGI may be an important global proxy to assess oceanographic conditions and changes in marine ecosystems in the North Atlan	[Fluhr, Julie; Strom, Hallvard; Descamps, Sebastien] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Postboks 6606 Langnes, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Fluhr, Julie; Pradel, Roger; Duriez, Olivier] Univ P Valery, Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, EPHE,CNRS,UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Beaugrand, Gregory] Univ Lille Nord France, Lab Oceanol & Geosci, Dept Syst Terre Enveloppes Superficielles, Stn Marine,CNRS,UMR LOG 8187, 28 Ave Foch, F-62930 Wimereux, France	Fluhr, J (reprint author), Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Postboks 6606 Langnes, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.; Fluhr, J (reprint author), Univ P Valery, Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, EPHE,CNRS,UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.	julie.fluhr@gmail.com			Norwegian Polar Institute; Norwegian seabird monitoring program SEAPOP	This study was funded by the Norwegian Polar Institute and the Norwegian seabird monitoring program SEAPOP (http://seapop.no/).

A test of trophic cascade theory: fish and benthic assemblages across a predator density gradient on coral reefs	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Community ecology; Fishing; Herbivory; Marine protected areas; Top-down effects	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; HERBIVORE BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGICAL ROLE; APEX PREDATORS; FOOD WEBS; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; STRENGTH; DIFFERENTIATION	Removal of predators is often hypothesized to alter community structure through trophic cascades. However, despite recent advances in our understanding of trophic cascades, evidence is often circumstantial on coral reefs because fishing pressure frequently co-varies with other anthropogenic effects, such as fishing for herbivorous fishes and changes in water quality due to pollution. Australia's outer Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has experienced fishing-induced declines of apex predators and mesopredators, but pollution and targeting of herbivorous fishes are minimal. Here, we quantify fish and benthic assemblages across a fishing-induced predator density gradient on the outer GBR, including apex predators and mesopredators to herbivores and benthic assemblages, to test for evidence of trophic cascades and alternative hypotheses to trophic cascade theory. Using structural equation models, we found no cascading effects from apex predators to lower trophic levels: a loss of apex predators did not lead to higher levels of mesopredators, and this did not suppress mobile herbivores and drive algal proliferation. Likewise, we found no effects of mesopredators on lower trophic levels: a decline of mesopredators was not associated with higher abundances of algae-farming damselfishes and algae-dominated reefs. These findings indicate that top-down forces on coral reefs are weak, at least on the outer GBR. We conclude that predator-mediated trophic cascades are probably the exception rather than the rule in complex ecosystems such as the outer GBR.

We analyzed 1773 stomach samples from 39 fish species collected during a bottom trawl survey of the eastern Chukchi Sea in the summer of 2012. We used hierarchical cluster analysis of diet dissimilarities on 21 of the most well sampled species to identify four distinct trophic guilds: gammarid amphipod consumers, benthic invertebrate generalists, fish and shrimp consumers, and zooplankton consumers. The trophic guilds reflect dominant prey types in predator diets. We used constrained analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) to determine if variation within the composite guild diets could be explained by a suite of non-diet variables. All CAP models explained a significant proportion of the variance in the diet matrices, ranging from 7% to 25% of the total variation. Explanatory variables tested included latitude, longitude, predator length, depth, and water mass. These results indicate a trophic guild structure is present amongst the demersal fish community during summer in the eastern Chukchi Sea. Regular monitoring of the food habits of the demersal fish community will be required to improve our understanding of the spatial, temporal, and interannual variation in diet composition, and to improve our ability to identify and predict the impacts of climate change and commercial development on the structure and functioning of the Chukchi Sea ecosystem.

Morphological and ecological evidence for two sympatric forms of Type B killer whale around the Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Predator; Cetacean; Diet; Stable isotopes; Photogrammetry	NORTH PACIFIC; ORCINUS-ORCA	Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are apex marine predators in Antarctica, but uncertainty over their taxonomic and ecological diversity constrains evaluations of their trophic interactions. We describe two distinct, sympatric forms sharing the characteristic pigmentation of Type B, the most common around the Antarctic Peninsula. Laser photogrammetry revealed nonoverlapping size differences among adults: Based on a body length index (BLI: blowhole to dorsal fin) adult females of the larger form ("B1") were 20 % longer than the smaller form ("B2"), and adult males were 24 % longer on average. Dorsal fins of B1 adult females were 19 % taller than B2 females, and adult males 32 % taller. Both types were strongly sexually dimorphic, but B1 more so, including for BLI (B1 males = 1.07x females; B2 = 1.05x) and especially for dorsal fin height (B1 male fins = 2.33x female; B2 = 2.10x). The characteristically large Type B eye patch was more extensive for B1 than B2, comprising 41 and 37 % of BLI, respectively. Average group size was also significantly different, with B1s in smaller groups (mean 7, range 1-14) and B2s more gregarious (mean 36, range 8-75). Stable isotope analysis of skin biopsies indicated dietary differences: a significantly lower nitrogen N-15/N-14 ratio in B2s supported observations of feeding primarily on krill consumers (e.g., pygoscelid penguins), while B1s prey mainly on predators of krill consumers (e.g., Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii). These differences likely represent adaptations to distinct foraging niches, which has led to genetic divergence; their ecology now needs further study.	[Durban, J.

While the trophic level and niche width are characteristic at population level, trophic overlap indicates the interaction between populations of a community. Three apex predators coexist in Uruguayan waters: Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), South American sea lion (SASL, Otaria flavescens) and South American fur seal (SAFS, Arctocephalus austrails). The two otariids consume different main prey species and have different isotopic niche, whereas feeding habits of Franciscana dolphin in Uruguayan waters remain practically unknown. This study aimed to determine Franciscana diet composition by stomach content and stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses, and to assess trophic overlap in diet composition as well as in isotopic niche space among the three apex predators. Diet composition of each species was estimated by Bayesian mixing models with prior information on the diet of predators. Moreover, Bayesian ellipses were used to define the isotopic niche space and overlap among the three species. Diets among predators varied: diet of SAFS was composed mainly by a few pelagic prey species, diet of SASL was more diverse and included pelagic and benthic preys, and for Franciscana dolphin the diet was mainly composed by coastal prey species. The SAFS had the largest isotopic niche area compared to the Franciscana and the SASL The isotopic niche of the SASL did not overlap with those of the other two species. Although the Franciscana and the SAFS overlap in isotopic space, they do not overlap in feeding areas; this is because particulate organic matter delta C-13 values increase from inner Rio de la Plata to the estuary and the Atlantic Coast. Here, the relevance of using different sources of information to reach strong conclusions about feeding habits of marine predators and about co-use of resources is shown, mainly in environments where variation in delta C-13 can be related to diverse reasons.

Declining Mercury Concentrations in Bluefin Tuna Reflect Reduced Emissions to the North Atlantic Ocean	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CHEMICAL FORM; HUMAN HEALTH; MARINE FISH; FOOD-CHAIN; BIOACCUMULATION; METHYLMERCURY; WATERS; METHYLATION; ATMOSPHERE; ESTUARINE	Tunas are apex predators in marine food webs that can accumulate mercury (Hg) to high concentrations and provide more Hg (similar to 40%) to the U.S population than any other source. We measured Hg concentrations in 1292 Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT, Thunnus thynnus) captured in the Northwest Atlantic from 2004 to 2012. ABFT Hg concentrations and variability increased nonlinearly with length, weight, and age, ranging from 0.25 to 3.15 mg kg(-1), and declined significantly at a rate of 0.018 +/- 0.003 mg kg(-1) per year or 19% over an 8-year period from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Notably, this decrease parallels comparably reduced anthropogenic Hg emission rates in North America and North Atlantic atmospheric Hg concentrations during this period, suggesting that recent efforts to decrease atmospheric Hg loading have rapidly propagated up marine food webs to a commercially important species. This is the first evidence to suggest that emission reduction efforts have resulted in lower Hg concentrations in large, long-lived fish.

Cascading effects of predation risk determine how marine predators become terrestrial prey on an oceanic island	ECOLOGY			English	Article						apex predators; barn owls; deer mice; giving up densities; indirect interactions; mesopredators; murrelets; predation; risk effects; seabirds; trophic cascade	MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; INVASIVE SPECIES REMOVAL; MESOPREDATOR RELEASE; DEER MICE; PEROMYSCUS-MANICULATUS; TROPHIC CASCADES; ALIEN PREDATORS; FOOD-CHAIN; BARN OWLS; PATCH USE	Apex predators can suppress the foraging activity of mesopredators, which may then result in cascading benefits for the prey of those mesopredators. We studied the interactions between a top predator, the Barn Owl (Tyto alba), and their primary prey, an island endemic deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus elusus), which in turn consumes the eggs of seabirds nesting on Santa Barbara Island in California. Scripps's Murrelets (Synthliboramphus scrippsi), a threatened nocturnal seabird, arrive annually to breed on this island, and whose first egg is particularly vulnerable to predation by mice. We took advantage of naturally occurring extreme variations in the density of mice and owls on the island over 3 years and predicted that (1) mouse foraging would decrease with increasing predation risk from owls and moonlight and (2) these decreases in foraging would reduce predation on murrelet eggs. We measured the giving up densities of mice with experimental foraging stations and found that mice were sensitive to predation risk and foraged less when owls were more abundant and less during the full moon compared to the new moon. We also monitored the fates of 151 murrelet eggs, and found that murrelet egg predation declined as owl abundance increased, and was lower during the full moon compared to the new moon. Moreover, high owl abundance suppressed egg predation even when mice were extremely abundant. We conclude that there is a behaviorally mediated cascade such that owls on the island had a positive indirect effect on murrelet egg survival. Our study adds to the wider recognition of the strength of risk effects to structure food webs, as well as highlighting the complex ways that marine and terrestrial food webs can intersect.

Assessing genetic variation in juvenile white sharks using teeth collected from landfills in Baja California, Mexico	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						mtDNA; Population divergence; Conservation; Bycatch	CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; GUADALUPE ISLAND; MIGRATION	Juvenile white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) spend their early years in coastal waters where they may be targeted by local fisheries or landed by-catch. Conservation of genetic resources for marine species becomes a main issue for apex predators such as sharks. We developed a protocol to extract DNA from teeth of mummified juvenile white shark heads found in a local landfill at Bahia Vizcaino Baja California. A total of 48 Baja California samples where sequenced for 984 bp of the hypervariable control region of mitochondrial DNA and identified to belong to the Northeast Pacific white shark clade. Population analysis revealed significant divergence between Australian sharks but did not differ significantly from samples in California. The use of preserved material such as shark theet, jaws or vertebrae from collections in museums or research institutions may help to track the genetic changes trough time in relation with resource exploitation range expansion, or depletion.

Global population genetic dynamics of a highly migratory, apex predator shark	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						genetic population structure; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; tiger shark	SEX-BIASED DISPERSAL; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; TIGER SHARKS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; HABITAT USE; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; AUSTRALIAN WATERS	Knowledge of genetic connectivity dynamics in the world's large-bodied, highly migratory, apex predator sharks across their global ranges is limited. One such species, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), occurs worldwide in warm temperate and tropical waters, uses remarkably diverse habitats (nearshore to pelagic) and possesses a generalist diet that can structure marine ecosystems through top-down processes. We investigated the phylogeography and the global population structure of this exploited, phylogenetically enigmatic shark by using 10 nuclear microsatellites (n = 380) and sequences from the mitochondrial control region (CR, n = 340) and cytochrome oxidase I gene (n = 100). All three marker classes showed the genetic differentiation between tiger sharks from the western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific ocean basins (microsatellite F-ST > 0.129; CR Phi(ST) > 0.497), the presence of North vs. southwestern Atlantic differentiation and the isolation of tiger sharks sampled from Hawaii from other surveyed locations. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA revealed high levels of intraocean basin matrilineal population structure, suggesting female philopatry and sex-biased gene flow. Coalescent-and genetic distance-based estimates of divergence from CR sequences were largely congruent (d(corr) = 0.0015-0.0050), indicating a separation of Indo-Pacific and western Atlantic tiger sharks <1 million years ago. Mitochondrial haplotype relationships suggested that the western South Atlantic Ocean was likely a historical connection for interocean basin linkages via the dispersal around South Africa. Together, the results reveal unexpectedly high levels of population structure in a highly migratory, behaviourally generalist, cosmopolitan ocean predator, calling for management and conservation on smaller-than-anticipated spatial scales.

However, the mechanistic basis for facultative scavenging remains poorly understood. The co-occurrence of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) at Raine Island (Australia), provides an opportunity to examine a top marine predator's feeding mode in response to seasonal pulses in nesting turtles that offer both hunting and scavenging opportunities. Using satellite telemetry, we evaluated home range overlap between sharks and turtles and quantified their surfacing behavior around Raine Island during the turtle nesting season. We found core home range overlap to be highest during the nesting season. Both sharks and turtles spent significantly more time at the surface in areas of greatest range overlap closest to shore, where turtle density was highest. Both sharks and turtles showed decreased surfacing with increasing distance from Raine Island. Combined with published data on turtle demography at Raine Island, we propose the following: (1) sharks patrol the surface to increase scavenging opportunities on turtle carcasses and intercept weakened individuals after nesting; (2) healthy turtles may not perceive sharks as a major threat and/or other biological factors override anti-predatory responses; and (3) sharks during the nesting season may primarily scavenge on dead turtles individuals rather than actively hunt. Our study results and approach may be applicable to other situations in which direct observations of predator-prey interactions are limited. Every animal encounters dead or dying resources, yet the role of facultative scavenging has been difficult to study, and thus largely overlooked in marine behavioral ecological research. Movement analyses of tiger shark and green turtle movement and surfacing behavior at Raine Island (Australia) suggest that facultative scavenging may be a prevalent, yet underappreciated, feeding strategy in tiger sharks. Our integration of behavioral ecology theory with multi-species electronic tagging provided a valuable approach for investigating predator-prey interactions in situations where direct observations are limited or not possible.

A fully coupled ecosystem model to predict the foraging ecology of apex predators in the California Current	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Ecosystem model; Foraging ecology; California Current; Upwelling; Sea lions; Marine predators; Zalophus californianus	LIONS ZALOPHUS-CALIFORNIANUS; NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; TRANSITION ZONE; OCEAN; PACIFIC; CLIMATE; FISH; CONSUMPTION	Results from a fully coupled end-to-end ecosystem model for the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem are used to describe the impact of environmental variability and prey availability on the foraging ecology of its most abundant apex predator, the California sea lion Zalophus californianus. The ecosystem model consists of a biogeochemical submodel embedded in a regional ocean circulation submodel, both coupled with a multi-species individual-based submodel for forage fish (sardine and anchovy) and California sea lions. Sardine and anchovy are explicitly represented in the model as they are commonly found in the diet of sea lions and exhibit significant interannual and decadal variability in population abundances that reflect variations in their environment and lower trophic level prey. Output from a 20 yr run (1989-2008) of the model demonstrates how different physical and biological processes control habitat utilization and foraging success of California sea lions on interannual time scales, with the dominant modes of variability linked to sardine abundance and coastal upwelling intensity. The results also illustrate how variability in environmental conditions, forage fish distribution, and prey assemblage affect sea lion feeding success. While specifically focusing on the foraging ecology of sea lions, the modeling framework has the ability to provide a more complete understanding of the physical and biological mechanisms impacting trophic interactions in the California Current, or other regions where similar fully coupled ecosystem models may be implemented.

Certain shark species, often feeding at, or near the top of the food-chain have the ability to bioaccumulate a suite of toxins, from both anthropogenic and algal sources. As such, these apex predators are likely sinks for CTXs. This assumption, in conjunction with anecdotal knowledge of poisoning incidents, several nonspecific feeding trials whereby various terrestrial animals were fed suspect fish flesh, and a single incident in Madagascar in 1994, have resulted in the widespread acceptance that sharks may accumulate CTXs. This prompted a study to investigate original claims within the literature, as well as investigate CTX bioaccumulation in the muscle and liver of 22 individual sharks from nine species, across four locations along the east coast of Australia. Utilizing an updated ciguatoxin extraction method with HPLC-MS/MS, we were unable to detect P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 or P-CTX-3, the three primary CTX congeners, in muscle or liver samples. We propose four theories to address this finding: (1) to date, methods have been optimized for teleost species and may not be appropriate for elasmobranchs, or the CI-Xs may be below the limit of detection; (2) CTX may be biotransformed into elasmobranch-specific congeners as a result of unique metabolic properties; (3) 22 individuals may be an inadequate sample size given the rare occurrence of high-order ciguatoxic organisms and potential for CTX depuration; and (4) the ephemeral nature and inconsistent toxin profiles of Gambierdiscus blooms may have undermined our classifications of certain areas as CTX hotspots. These results, in combination with the lack of clarity within the literature, suggest that ciguatoxin bioaccumulation in sharks remains elusive, and warrants further investigation to determine the dynamics of toxin production, accumulation and transformation throughout the entire food-web.

Into the deep: the functionality of mesopelagic excursions by an oceanic apex predator	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Apex predator; deep-diving behavior; foraging; k-means cluster analysis; mesopelagic zone; satellite tagging	WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; SHARKS CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; SCALLOPED HAMMERHEAD SHARKS; MAKO ISURUS-OXYRINCHUS; OFFSHORE FORAGING AREA; DIVING BEHAVIOR; SPHYRNA-LEWINI; SHORTFIN MAKO; WHALE SHARKS; CARCHARHINUS-LONGIMANUS	Comprehension of ecological processes in marine animals requires information regarding dynamic vertical habitat use. While many pelagic predators primarily associate with epipelagic waters, some species routinely dive beyond the deep scattering layer. Actuation for exploiting these aphotic habitats remains largely unknown. Recent telemetry data from oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) in the Atlantic show a strong association with warm waters (>20 degrees C) less than 200 m. Yet, individuals regularly exhibit excursions into the meso-and bathypelagic zone. In order to examine deep-diving behavior in oceanic whitetip sharks, we physically recovered 16 pop-up satellite archival tags and analyzed the high-resolution depth and temperature data. Diving behavior was evaluated in the context of plausible functional behavior hypotheses including interactive behaviors, energy conservation, thermoregulation, navigation, and foraging. Mesopelagic excursions (n = 610) occurred throughout the entire migratory circuit in all individuals, with no indication of site specificity. Six depth-versus-time descent and ascent profiles were identified. Descent profile shapes showed little association with examined environmental variables. Contrastingly, ascent profile shapes were related to environmental factors and appear to represent unique behavioral responses to abiotic conditions present at the dive apex. However, environmental conditions may not be the sole factors influencing ascents, as ascent mode may be linked to intentional behaviors. While dive functionality remains unconfirmed, our study suggests that mesopelagic excursions relate to active foraging behavior or navigation. Dive timing, prey constituents, and dive shape support foraging as the most viable hypothesis for mesopelagic excursions, indicating that the oceanic whitetip shark may regularly survey extreme environments (deep depths, low temperatures) as a foraging strategy. At the apex of these deep-water excursions, sharks exhibit a variable behavioral response, perhaps, indicating the presence or absence of prey.	[Howey, Lucy A.; Tolentino, Emily R.; Jordan, Lance K.

Geographical distribution patterns of Carcharocles megalodon over time reveal clues about extinction mechanisms	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						apex predator; area coverage; extinction drivers; Miocene; Pliocene; sharks; species occupancy	TOOTHED WHITE SHARKS; SPERM-WHALE; RISK; NEOGENE; DRIVERS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; TEMPERATURE; CARCHARIAS; DIVERSITY; DINOSAURS	AimGiven its catastrophic consequences, the extinction of apex predators has long been of interest to modern ecology. Despite major declines, no present-day species of marine apex predator has yet become extinct. Because of their vulnerability, understanding the mechanisms leading to their extinction in the past could provide insight into the natural factors that interact with human threats to drive their loss. We studied the geographical distribution patterns of the extinct macro-predatory shark Carcharocles megalodon in order to elucidate its pathway to extinction. LocationWorld-wide from the Miocene to the Pliocene (c.23-2.6Ma). MethodsA meta-analysis of C.megalodon occurrence records was performed using the Paleobiology Database as a platform. The data were binned into geological time slices, and the circular home range around each data point was mapped in reconstructions made in GPlates. We then quantitatively assessed the species' geographical range and global abundance over time, and the relationship between distribution and climate. ResultsThe pathway to extinction of C.megalodon probably started in the late Miocene with a decrease in its global abundance. This decrease was then followed by a decline in its geographical range during the Pliocene. Although the extinction of C.megalodon has been attributed to climate change, we found no evidence of direct effects of global temperature. Instead, we found that the collapse in geographical distribution coincided mainly with a drop in the diversity of filter-feeding whales and the appearance of new competitors (large predatory whales and the great white shark). Main conclusionsThis research represents the first study of the distributional trends of an extinct, cosmopolitan apex predator in deep-time. Our results suggest that biotic factors, and not direct temperature limitations, were probably the primary drivers of the extinction of the largest marine apex predators that ever lived.

Some Arctic marine mammals, such as the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), may be particularly vulnerable to such changes due to the loss of Arctic sea ice. We evaluated the impacts of environmental variation on demographic rates for the Western Hudson Bay (WH), polar bear subpopulation from 1984 to 2011 using live-recapture and dead-recovery data in a Bayesian implementation of multistate capture-recapture models. We found that survival of female polar bears was related to the annual timing of sea ice break-up and formation. Using estimated vital rates (e.g., survival and reproduction) in matrix projection models, we calculated the growth rate of the WH subpopulation and projected population responses under different environmental scenarios while accounting for parametric uncertainty, temporal variation, and demographic stochasticity. Our analysis suggested a long-term decline in the number of bears from 1185 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] = 993-1411) in 1987 to 806 (95% BCI = 653-984) in 2011. In the last 10 yr of the study, the number of bears appeared stable due to temporary stability in sea ice conditions (mean population growth rate for the period 2001-2010 = 1.02, 95% BCI = 0.98-1.06). Looking forward, we estimated long-term growth rates for the WH subpopulation of similar to 1.02 (95% BCI = 1.00-1.05) and 0.97 (95% BCI = 0.92-1.01) under hypothetical high and low sea ice conditions, respectively. Our findings support previous evidence for a demographic linkage between sea ice conditions and polar bear population dynamics. Furthermore, we present a robust framework for sensitivity analysis with respect to continued climate change (e.g., to inform scenario planning) and for evaluating the combined effects of climate change and management actions on the status of wildlife populations.

An integrated mark-recapture and genetic approach to estimate the population size of white sharks in South Africa	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Carcharodon carcharias; Effective population size; Microsatellites; Photographic identification; Population abundance; Shark conservation	CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS LINNAEUS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; RE-IMPLEMENTATION; N-E; CONSERVATION; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; FISHERIES; ABUNDANCE	The loss of apex marine predators has been reported to have a cascade of detrimental effects on marine ecosystems; however, the general lack of empirical data can severely limit our understanding of the ecological interactions among marine species. In this study we propose an integrated approach using mark-recapture and genetic techniques to assess population estimates of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias. Between 2009 and 2011, 4389 dorsal fin photographic identifications were collected in Gansbaai, South Africa, from 426 white sharks and used in mark-recapture analyses. Saturation of new sightings occurred once 400 individuals were catalogued and the open population model POPAN suggested ranges between 353 and 522 individuals (95% confidence) and a point estimate of N = 438. Between 2010 and 2013, 302 biopsy samples were collected from 233 white sharks and used for a comparative genetic population estimate. Analyses of 14 microsatellite markers revealed a contemporary effective population size (CNe) of 333 individuals (95% CI = 247-487, p(crit) = 0.02). These values were at least 52% less than those estimated in previous mark-recapture studies. Using this combination of techniques, we propose a N-e:N ratio of 0.76 for white sharks, which advances our ability to accurately make inferences on elasmobranch population numbers in general. Given the low population numbers of white sharks along the South African coastline, we predict a negative effect on the ecological stability of the marine environment in this region.

Basic information on prey selection, search effort, and capture rates are critical for understanding a predator's role in its ecosystem and for predicting its response to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Yet, for most marine species, foraging interactions cannot be observed directly. The high costs of thermoregulation in water require that small marine mammals have elevated energy intakes compared to similar-sized terrestrial mammals [1]. The combination of high food requirements and their position at the apex of most marine food webs may make small marine mammals particularly vulnerable to changes within the ecosystem [2-4], but the lack of detailed information about their foraging behavior often precludes an informed conservation effort. Here, we use high-resolution movement and prey echo recording tags on five wild harbor porpoises to examine foraging interactions in one of the most metabolically challenged cetacean species. We report that porpoises forage nearly continuously day and night, attempting to capture up to 550 small (3-10 cm) fish prey per hour with a remarkable prey capture success rate of >90%. Porpoises therefore target fish that are smaller than those of commercial interest, but must forage almost continually to meet their metabolic demands with such small prey, leaving little margin for compensation. Thus, for these "aquatic shrews," even a moderate level of anthropogenic disturbance in the busy shallow waters they share with humans may have severe fitness consequences at individual and population levels.

Protected areas preserve natural behaviour of a targeted fish species on coral reefs	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						No-entry zones; Escape trajectories; Marine reserves; Fishing; Fish behaviour; Behavioural traits	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCE; PLECTROPOMUS-LEOPARDUS; APEX PREDATORS; POPULATIONS; SELECTION; HABITAT; TRAITS; TROUT; RISK	Marine protected areas are increasingly being implemented to attain a variety of conservation and fisheries management objectives. Although rarely considered, protection of targeted species within these areas may also conserve behaviours (e.g. boldness) that are often the first removed by human exploitation. Here we examine fish behaviour in fished, no-take, and no-entry management zones for a highly targeted reef fish species (coral trout; Plectropomus leopardus) on coral reefs in two regions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Using three behavioural metrics (flight-initiation distance, pre-flight behaviour, and escape trajectories), we demonstrate how protected areas, particularly no-entry zones, can effectively conserve naive or bold behavioural traits in fish populations. Flight-initiation distance was consistently highest in fished zones, but the effects of protection afforded by no-take and no-entry zones varied by study region. Flight-initiation distance was consistently higher for fish above the minimum legal retention size limit, except in no-entry zones of the southern region. This indicates that no-entry zones may be maintaining near-natural, pre-exploitation behaviour, which could have considerable implications for the genetic and social structures of a highly valuable commercial species. Conservation and fisheries management would therefore benefit from an increased understanding of how fish behaviour can influence population structures, and how these populations may be influenced by fishing and other human interactions.

Knowledge on its ecology, which is crucial to design proper conservation and management plans, is very scarce. Here we describe the isolation of eight polymorphic microsatellite loci using 454 GS-FLX Titanium pyrosequencing of enriched DNA libraries. Their characteristics were tested on a population of tiger shark (n = 101) from Reunion Island (South-Western Indian Ocean). All loci were polymorphic with a number of alleles ranging from two to eight. No null alleles were detected and no linkage disequilibrium was detected after Bonferroni correction. Observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.03 to 0.76 and from 0.03 to 0.77, respectively. No locus deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the global F-IS of the population was of 0.04(NS). Some of the eight loci developed here successfully cross-amplified in the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas (one locus), the spinner shark Carcharhinus brevi pi n n a (four loci), the sandbar shark Carcharhinus plumbeus (five loci) and the scalloped hammerhead shark Sphyrna lewini (two loci). We also designed primers to amplify and sequence a mitochondrial marker, the control region. We sequenced 862 bp and found a low genetic diversity, with four polymorphic sites, a haplotype diversity of 0.15 and a nucleotide diversity of 2 x 10(-4).

Finding the way to the top: how the composition of oceanic mid-trophic micronekton groups determines apex predator biomass in the central North Pacific	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Forage species; Hawaii longline fishery; North Pacific Subtropical Gyre; Ecopath with Ecosim; Ecosystem modeling; Climate change; Marine food webs	EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC; RECONSTRUCTING ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS; COUPLED CLIMATE MODELS; GULF-OF-MEXICO; MESOPELAGIC FISHES; CALIFORNIA CURRENT; HAWAIIAN WATERS; PELAGIC ECOSYSTEM; SUBTROPICAL GYRE; OMMASTREPHES-BARTRAMII	We updated and expanded a model of the pelagic ecosystem for the area of the central North Pacific occupied by the Hawaii-based longline fishery. Specifically, results from the most recent diet studies were used to expand the representation of the lesser-known non-target fish species (e.g. lancetfish, opah, snake mackerel) and 9 mid-trophic micronekton functional groups. The model framework Ecopath with Ecosim was used to construct an ecosystem energy budget and to examine how changes in the various micronekton groups impact apex predator biomass. Model results indicate that while micronekton fishes represented approximately 54% of micronekton biomass, they accounted for only 28% of the micronekton production. By contrast, crustaceans represented 24% of the biomass and accounted for 44% of production. Simulated ecosystem changes resulting from changes to micronekton groups demonstrated that crustaceans and mollusks are the most important direct trophic pathways to the top of the food web. Other groups appear to comprise relatively inefficient pathways or 'trophic dead-ends' that are loosely coupled to the top of the food web (e.g. gelatinous animals), such that biomass declines in these functional groups resulted in increased biomass at the highest trophic levels by increasing energy flow through more efficient pathways. Overall, simulated declines in the micronekton groups resulted in small changes in biomass at the very top of the food web, suggesting that this ecosystem is relatively ecologically resilient with diverse food web pathways. However, further understanding of how sensitive micronekton are to changes in ocean chemistry and temperature resulting from climate change is needed to fully evaluate and predict potential ecosystem changes.

The Ecological Role of Sharks on Coral Reefs	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Review							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MARINE FOOD-WEB; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; TROPHIC CASCADES; APEX PREDATORS; HEMISCYLLIUM-OCELLATUM; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; TIGER SHARKS; NEGAPRION-BREVIROSTRIS	Sharks are considered the apex predator of coral reefs, but the consequences of their global depletion are uncertain. Here we explore the ecological roles of sharks on coral reefs and, conversely, the importance of reefs for sharks. We find that most reef-associated shark species do not act as apex predators but instead function as mesopredators along with a diverse group of reef fish. While sharks perform important direct and indirect ecological roles, the evidence to support hypothesised shark-driven trophic cascades that benefit corals is weak and equivocal. Coral reefs provide some functional benefits to sharks, but sharks do not appear to favour healthier reef environments. Restoring populations of sharks is important and can yet deliver ecological surprise.

Ontogeny of head and caudal fin shape of an apex marine predator: The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)	JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY			English	Article						sharks; morphology; ontogeny; ecology; form	RATFISH HYDROLAGUS-COLLIEI; WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; BITE FORCE; HETEROCERCAL TAIL; CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; CARCHARHINUS-PLUMBEUS; FLOW VISUALIZATION; MECHANICAL DESIGN; FEEDING MECHANICS; SQUALUS-ACANTHIAS	How morphology changes with size can have profound effects on the life history and ecology of an animal. For apex predators that can impact higher level ecosystem processes, such changes may have consequences for other species. Tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) are an apex predator in tropical seas, and, as adults, are highly migratory. However, little is known about ontogenetic changes in their body form, especially in relation to two aspects of shape that influence locomotion (caudal fin) and feeding (head shape). We captured digital images of the heads and caudal fins of live tiger sharks from Southern Florida and the Bahamas ranging in body size (hence age), and quantified shape of each using elliptical Fourier analysis. This revealed changes in the shape of the head and caudal fin of tiger sharks across ontogeny. Smaller juvenile tiger sharks show an asymmetrical tail with the dorsal (upper) lobe being substantially larger than the ventral (lower) lobe, and transition to more symmetrical tail in larger adults, although the upper lobe remains relatively larger in adults. The heads of juvenile tiger sharks are more conical, which transition to relatively broader heads over ontogeny. We interpret these changes as a result of two ecological transitions. First, adult tiger sharks can undertake extensive migrations and a more symmetrical tail could be more efficient for swimming longer distances, although we did not test this possibility. Second, adult tiger sharks expand their diet to consume larger and more diverse prey with age (turtles, mammals, and elasmobranchs), which requires substantially greater bite area and force to process. In contrast, juvenile tiger sharks consume smaller prey, such as fishes, crustaceans, and invertebrates. Our data reveal significant morphological shifts in an apex predator, which could have effects for other species that tiger sharks consume and interact with. J. Morphol. 277:556-564, 2016.

The benefits of spatial management zones, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), for such animals are unclear. To help fill this knowledge gap, we examined core habitat use areas (CHUAs) for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in relation to specific MPAs and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. MethodsBull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks (N=86 total) were satellite tagged and tracked in southern Florida and the northern Bahamas between 2010 and 2013. Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation. ResultsA total of 0%, 17.9% and 34.7% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area. Main conclusionsExpansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts. These findings also provide a means to inform decision makers and marine conservation planning efforts as to the types of management actions available and potential efficacy of spatial protections for these marine predators.

Seabirds are predators often used as indicator species to monitor the status and health of their communities and the environment. Here, we present the results from a 35-year monitoring time series of Brown Skuas (Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi) and South Polar Skuas (C. maccormicki) breeding sympatrically in the Maritime Antarctic on Fildes Peninsula and Potter Peninsula, King George Island. Our results reveal high annual variability in the number and proportions of breeding pairs across the entire study period. Apart from that, the breeding pair numbers of Brown Skuas were relatively stable. By contrast, the breeding pair number of mixed species and South Polar Skua pairs increased substantially until 2003/2004 and 2010/2011, respectively. Both pair types experienced a decline in the breeding pair numbers within recent years. Despite the strong fluctuations in the number of breeding pairs, the sum of occupied territories has been stable during the last 9 years. The breeding success of all pair types declined significantly, and within recent years, both South Polar Skuas and mixed species pairs completely failed to produce offspring. The ultimate causes driving the breeding success decline remain unclear. The overall increase in the number of skuas might have raised density-dependent factors and resulted in a higher predation rate between conspecifics. The more recent total breeding failures, however, indicate a drastic shortage in local food availability.

Time series of animal movement obtained from bio-loggers are becoming widely used across all taxa. These data are nowadays of high quality, combining high resolution with precision, as the tags are able to collect for longer times and store larger quantities of data. Due to their nature, high-frequency data sequences often pose non-trivial problems in time series analysis: nonlinearity, non-normality, non-stationarity and long memory. These issues can be tackled by modelling the data sequence as a realization of a stochastic regime-switching process. 2. We suggest a novel Markov switching autoregressive model where the hidden Markov chain is non-homogeneous, with time-varying transition probabilities, whose dynamics depend on the dynamics of some contemporary categorical covariates. 3. To illustrate the use of the method, we apply it to the depth profiles of four individuals of flapper skate (Dipturus cf. intermedia) in order to identify swimming behaviours. Individual time series were obtained from data storage tags that recorded pressure every two minutes. The environmental covariates used were lunar phase (a proxy for the spring-neap tidal cycle), lunar cycle and diel cycle. For all individuals, two states (or regimes) were always selected (the autoregressive order was either three or four), representing different regimes of animal activity, that is state 1 for resting or horizontal swimming or slow vertical movement and state 2 for fast ascending and descending. The cycle of the four lunar phases was the only environmental covariate that explained the hidden state dynamics in all individuals, whereas lunar cycle was selected for two individuals and diel cycle for one only. 4. The method is an efficient approach to fit one-dimensional tag data using categorical environmental covariates, and to classify the observations into a small number of states representing individual behaviours of tagged individuals.

The cephalopod prey of the Weddell seal, Leptonychotes weddellii, a biological sampler of the Antarctic marine ecosystem	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Antarctica; Leptonychotes weddellii; Diet; Cephalopods; Stable isotopes	SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS; DIET; OCEAN; OCTOPODIDAE; LOCALITIES; PREDATORS; PENINSULA; BEHAVIOR; EASTERN; FOOD	Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, are important apex predators in the food web of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. However, detailed information on their trophic relationships with cephalopods is scarce. Moreover, cephalopods play a key role in the marine environment, but knowledge of their feeding habits is limited by lack of data. Here, we have combined the use of this seal as a biological sampler together with measurements of the stable isotopic signature of the beaks of their cephalopod prey. Thus, the aims of the present study were: (1) to examine in detail the cephalopod portion of the diet of Weddell seals by means of scat analysis and (2) to assess the habitat use and trophic level of the different cephalopod prey taxa identified. From January to February 2009, a total of 48 faecal droppings were collected at Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. Cephalopods were mainly represented by beaks (n = 83) which were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Furthermore, subsamples of beaks were separated for further isotopic analysis. Relative abundance of stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) was determined by continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Cephalopods were represented uniquely by octopods of the subfamily Eledoninae. Pareledone turqueti was the dominant prey species followed by the papillated Pareledone species group and Adelieledone polymorpha. We conclude that Weddell seals preyed primarily on benthic prey resources. Furthermore, the relatively similar delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in beaks of the three octopod prey taxa suggest that these share the same type of habitat and occupy similar trophic level positions.

Stratifying herbivore fisheries by habitat to avoid ecosystem overfishing of coral reefs	FISH AND FISHERIES			English	Article						ecosystem-based management; parrotfish	GALAPAGOS MARINE RESERVE; BARRIER-REEF; SPECIES COMPOSITION; DIADEMA-ANTILLARUM; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; MACROALGAL COVER; PHASE-SHIFT; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITIES; COMPETITION	The problem of ecosystem overfishing has mostly focused on the function of forage fish as prey for apex predators. Here, I consider another ecosystem function, herbivory, that affects habitat quality. Parrotfish are an important fishery in many parts of the Caribbean and the dominant herbivorous fish on its coral reefs. Herbivory helps to control macroalgae which compete with coral and can impede reef resilience if allowed to bloom. Thus, long-term maintenance of reef habitat quality, which underpins fisheries, requires sufficient parrotfish stock. Ecosystem models predict that reductions in parrotfish grazing could have deleterious impacts on reef habitat yet the determination of ecologically sustainable levels of parrotfish harvest remains elusive. An initial solution to this dilemma is proposed for areas where an outright ban on herbivore exploitation is considered infeasible. Fisheries management has tended to consider coral reefs as a single habitat such that regulations apply evenly throughout exploitable areas. But reef habitats are not equally susceptible to ecosystem overfishing and some do not appear to have a strong requirement for parrotfish grazing. One habitat, Orbicella reef, has a high dependence on herbivory, whereas the state of another dominant habitat - gorgonian plain - appears to be driven by environmental factors (e.g. wave exposure). Ecosystem-based fisheries management could be improved by restricting parrotfish harvest on Orbicella reefs yet allowing exploitation on gorgonian plain. Management could then focus on achieving a sustainable yield on gorgonian plains without the added complexity of estimating catch levels that avoid ecosystem overfishing.

The tested indicators include the slope of the biomass spectrum, the mean trophic level (MTL), the marine trophic index (MTI) and two newly developed indicators, the high trophic level indicator (HTI) and the apex predator indicator (API). Indicators are compared between current state and potential reference situations, using as case studies: the Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay, North Sea and English Channel ecosystems. Trophic spectra are obtained from Ecopath models while reference situations are estimated, simulating with EcoTroph and Ecosim different fishing pressures including three candidate scenarios for an EAFM. Inter-ecosystems assessments are done using Ecopath models, simulations outputs and scientific surveys data to assess the current states of the studied ecosystems, contrast the reference situations and analyze the responses of all indicators. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted on the main simulation parameters to test the robustness of the chosen indicators. Ecosystems specific targets for EAFM are proposed for the five trophic indicators estimated from whole-ecosystem models, while in the Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay ecosystem targets are proposed for the MTL (=3.85) and HTI (48%) estimated from standard bottom-trawl surveys. The HTI is proposed to be relevant for survey data and the API is recommended using whole-ecosystem models. We conclude that HTI and API show trends in ecosystems health better than MTI.

Gigantism and Its Implications for the History of Life	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DINOSAUR BODY TEMPERATURES; ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN; SAUROPOD DINOSAURS; POLAR GIGANTISM; SIZE EVOLUTION; APEX PREDATOR; BONY FISHES; SEA-TURTLE; COPES RULE; FOSSIL	Gigantism-very large body size-is an ecologically important trait associated with competitive superiority. Although it has been studied in particular cases, the general conditions for the evolution and maintenance of gigantism remain obscure. I compiled sizes and dates for the largest species in 3 terrestrial and 7 marine trophic and habitat categories of animals from throughout the Phanerozoic. The largest species (global giants) in all categories are of post-Paleozoic age. Gigantism at this level appeared tens to hundreds of millions of years after mass extinctions and long after the origins of clades in which it evolved. Marine gigantism correlates with high planktic or seafloor productivity, but on land the correspondence between productivity and gigantism is weak at best. All global giants are aerobically active animals, not gentle giants with low metabolic demands. Oxygen concentration in the atmosphere correlates with gigantism in the Paleozoic but not thereafter, likely because of the elaboration of efficient gas-exchange systems in clades containing giants. Although temperature and habitat size are important in the evolution of very large size in some cases, the most important (and rare) enabling circumstance is a highly developed ecological infrastructure in which essential resources are abundant and effectively recycled and reused, permitting activity levels to increase and setting the stage for gigantic animals to evolve. Gigantism as a hallmark of competitive superiority appears to have lost its luster on land after the Mesozoic in favor of alternative means of achieving dominance, especially including social organization and coordinated food-gathering.

Stomachs of 406 specimens in the fork length range of 48 to 165.5 cm caught during exploratory longlining conducted in the eastern Arabian Sea during 2006 to 2009 were examined, of which, 15.52% were empty. Purple back flying squid (Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) was the dominant prey species, followed by the swimming crab (Charybdis smithii), bigeye cigarfish (Cubiceps pauciradiatus) and flyingfishes (family Exocoetidae). Diet breadth index and the modified Costello diagram showed dominance of few prey species which are available in high densities in the Arabian Sea, indicating opportunistic feeding nature of this apex predator. Diet did not significantly differ between sexes and size groups. Higher food intake during premonsoon and winter monsoon indicated a seasonal variation in diet. A steady increase in the abundance of C. smithii and a decrease in the proportion of S. oualaniensis in the diet were observed from premonsoon to winter monsoon seasons. Yellowfin tuna in the Arabian Sea consume an average of 545.65 g of food in a day and require daily ration of 1.95% body weight per day.	[Varghese, Sijo P.; Somvanshi, V.

Yet our knowledge of cetacean hearing is still limited to a few dozen species, therefore compromising any attempt to design adaptive management strategies. The use of auditory evoked potentials allows scientists to rapidly and noninvasively obtain the hearing data of species rarely available in captivity. Unfortunately, many practical and ethical reasons still limit the availability of large whales, thus restricting the possibility to effectively ensure that anthropogenic sounds have minimum effects on these species. The example of a recent Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris) audiogram collected after a stranding indicated, for instance, very specialized hearing between 40 and 50 kHz, which corresponded to the frequency-modulated upsweep signals used by this species during echolocation. The methods used during a stranding event are presented along with the major difficulties that have slowed down the scientific community in measuring the audition of large whales and the potential value in obtaining such results when successful.

Cephalopod species in the diet of large pelagic fish (sharks and billfishes) in Ecuadorian waters	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Ecuadorian waters; Billfishes; Sharks; Cephalopods; Dosidicus gigas; Trophic ecology	SQUID DOSIDICUS-GIGAS; SAILFISH ISTIOPHORUS-PLATYPTERUS; GULF-OF-CALIFORNIA; JUMBO SQUID; XIPHIAS-GLADIUS; THRESHER SHARK; FOOD-HABITS; ALOPIAS-SUPERCILIOSUS; SCALLOPED HAMMERHEAD; ISURUS-OXYRINCHUS	Large pelagic fish species are apex predators in the ecosystem of the Pacific Ocean, and they represent important economic resources for fisheries. In Ecuador there is a fishery for billfish such as Istophorus platypterus, Xiphias gladius, Makaira nigricans, and Kajikia audax, in which sharks such as Prionace glauca and Isurus oxyrinchus are also caught. Their prey includes small fish and cephalopods. We studied the trophic ecology of sharks and billfish captured in Santa Rosa (Salinas) and Playita Mia (Manta) Ecuador during 2013 and 2014, in order to evaluate their trophic relationship with different cephalopod species. Our results show that cephalopods are the most important prey in the diet of sharks (%IRI = 61.6) and billfishes (%IRI = 77.5). Twenty two species of cephalopods of the Orders Octopoda, Vampyromorphida and Teuthida were identified in the stomach contents, with Dosidicus gigas, Ancistrocheirus lesueurii and Histioteuthis dofleini being the most important. We also demonstrated that squid are abundant in waters off Ecuador. The ommastrephid D. gigas was the main prey for billfish (%IRI = 93.7 for X. gladius) and the second most important for sharks (%IRI = 44.9 for I. oxyrinchus). Cephalopods are key prey items for predatory pelagic fish in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Ecuador. Further studies on the diet of these fish species are needed to better understand their role as top-level predators in the marine food web and to improve knowledge of the diversity of cephalopods in the region.

In the present study, body feathers of > 200 wandering albatrosses from Possession Island in the Crozet archipelago were used to explore the potential demographic effects of the long-term exposure to Hg on an apex predator. Variations of Hg with sex, age class, foraging habitat (inferred from delta C-13 values), and feeding habits (inferred from delta N-15 values) were examined as well as the influence of Hg on current breeding output, long-term fecundity and survival. Wandering albatrosses displayed among the highest Hg feather concentrations reported for seabirds, ranging from 5.9 to 95 mu g g(-1), as a consequence of their high trophic position (delta N-15 values). These concentrations fall within the same range of those of other wandering albatross populations from subantarctic sites, suggesting that this species has similar exposure to Hg all around the Southern Ocean. In both immature and adult albatrosses, females had higher Hg concentrations than males (28 vs. 20 mu g g(-1) dw on average, respectively), probably as a consequence of females foraging at lower latitudes than males (delta C-13 values). Hg concentrations were higher in immature than in adult birds, and they remained fairly constant across a wide range of ages in adults. Such high levels in immature individuals question (i) the frequency of moult in young birds, (ii) the efficiency of Hg detoxification processes in immatures compared to adults, and (iii) importantly the potential detrimental effects of Hg in early life. Despite very high Hg concentrations in their feathers, neither effects on adults' breeding probability, hatching failure and fledgling failure, nor on adults' survival rate were detected, suggesting that long-term bioaccumulated Hg was not under a chemical form leading to deleterious effects on reproductive parameters in adult individuals.

Liver samples from dusky Carcharhinus obscurus, sandbar Carcharhirzus plumbeus, and white Carcharodon carcharias sharks from south-eastern Australian waters were analysed for the seven indicator PCBs 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180. Median Sigma PCBs were significantly higher in white than sandbar sharks (3.35 and 036 mu g g(-1) lipid, respectively,p = 0.05) but there were no significant differences between dusky sharks (1.31 mu g g(-1) lipid) and the other two species. Congener concentrations were also significantly higher in white sharks. Significant differences in PCB concentrations between mature and immature dusky (3.78 and 0.76 mu g g(-1) lipid, respectively) and sandbar (1.94 and 0.18 mu g g(-1) lipid, respectively) sharks indicated that PCB concentrations in these species increased with age/growth. Higher-chlorinated congeners (hexa and heptachlorobiphenyls) dominated results, accounting for similar to 90% of Sigma PCBs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An Integrated Coral Reef Ecosystem Model to Support Resource Management under a Changing Climate	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; REGION-WIDE DECLINES; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; FISHES; IMPACTS; RECOVERY; FUTURE; DISTURBANCE; RESPONSES	Millions of people rely on the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs, but sustaining these benefits requires an understanding of how reefs and their biotic communities are affected by local human-induced disturbances and global climate change. Ecosystembased management that explicitly considers the indirect and cumulative effects of multiple disturbances has been recommended and adopted in policies in many places around the globe. Ecosystem models give insight into complex reef dynamics and their responses to multiple disturbances and are useful tools to support planning and implementation of ecosystem-based management. We adapted the Atlantis Ecosystem Model to incorporate key dynamics for a coral reef ecosystem around Guam in the tropical western Pacific. We used this model to quantify the effects of predicted climate and ocean changes and current levels of current land-based sources of pollution (LBSP) and fishing. We used the following six ecosystem metrics as indicators of ecosystem state, resilience and harvest potential: 1) ratio of calcifying to non-calcifying benthic groups, 2) trophic level of the community, 3) biomass of apex predators, 4) biomass of herbivorous fishes, 5) total biomass of living groups and 6) the end-to-start ratio of exploited fish groups. Simulation tests of the effects of each of the three drivers separately suggest that by mid-century climate change will have the largest overall effect on this suite of ecosystem metrics due to substantial negative effects on coral cover. The effects of fishing were also important, negatively influencing five out of the six metrics. Moreover, LBSP exacerbates this effect for all metrics but not quite as badly as would be expected under additive assumptions, although the magnitude of the effects of LBSP are sensitive to uncertainty associated with primary productivity. Over longer time spans (i.e., 65 year simulations), climate change impacts have a slight positive interaction with other drivers, generally meaning that declines in ecosystem metrics are not as steep as the sum of individual effects of the drivers. These analyses offer one way to quantify impacts and interactions of particular stressors in an ecosystem context and so provide guidance to managers. For example, the model showed that improving water quality, rather than prohibiting fishing, extended the timescales over which corals can maintain high abundance by at least 5-8 years. This result, in turn, provides more scope for corals to adapt or for resilient species to become established and for local and global management efforts to reduce or reverse stressors.

Peculiar macrophagous adaptations in a new Cretaceous pliosaurid	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						Plesiosauria; Pliosauridae; Cretaceous; macrophagy; convergence; Makhaira rossica	CRANIAL ANATOMY; PLESIOSAURIA; SAUROPTERYGIA; REPTILIA; THALATTOSUCHIA; MORPHOLOGY; WILTSHIRE; EVOLUTION; WESTBURY; UK	During the Middle and Late Jurassic, pliosaurid plesiosaurs evolved gigantic body size and a series of craniodental adaptations that have been linked to the occupation of an apex predator niche. Cretaceous pliosaurids (i.e. Brachaucheninae) depart from this morphology, being slightly smaller and lacking the macrophagous adaptations seen in earlier forms. However, the fossil record of Early Cretaceous pliosaurids is poor, concealing the evolution and ecological diversity of the group. Here, we report a new pliosaurid from the Late Hauterivian (Early Cretaceous) of Russia. Phylogenetic analyses using reduced consensus methods recover it as the basalmost brachauchenine. This pliosaurid is smaller than other derived pliosaurids, has tooth alveoli clustered in pairs and possesses trihedral teeth with complex serrated carinae. Maximum-likelihood ancestral state reconstruction suggests early brachauchenines retained trihedral teeth from their ancestors, butmodified this feature in a uniqueway, convergent with macrophagous archosaurs or sphenacodontoids. Our findings indicate that Early Cretaceous marine reptile teeth with serrated carinae cannot be unequivocally assigned to metriorhynchoid crocodylomorphs. Furthermore, they extend the known diversity of dental adaptations seen in Sauropterygia, the longest lived clade of marine tetrapods.	[Fischer, Valentin; Benson, Roger B.

Monitoring of contaminants and their effects on the common Guillemot and the White-tailed sea eagle	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th International Ornithological Congress (IOC)	AUG 18-24, 2014	Rikkyo Univ, Tokyo, JAPAN		Rikkyo Univ	Contaminant; Desiccation; Eagle; Egg; Guillemot; Herring; Monitoring; Reproduction; Shell-thickness	POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS; URIA-AALGE EGG; TEMPORAL TRENDS; BALTIC SEA; HALIAEETUS-ALBICILLA; BALD EAGLE; RESIDUE LEVELS; MERCURY; SWEDEN	A main purpose of marine contaminant monitoring in Europe is to evaluate the chemical status and environmental quality under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), to monitor and achieve Good Environmental Status (GES). Characteristics of a good matrix for monitoring purposes are the potential to detect temporal trends or differences between sites or concentration levels in relation to a target value indicating GES. In Sweden we use muscle of herring and eggs of guillemot and White-tailed sea eagle (WTSE) to study changes in contaminant exposure and their effects. Herring is important in fisheries and has target levels set for contaminants in relation to GES. Adult guillemots and eagles in the Baltic Sea are mainly stationary. Guillemots feed largely on herring, WTSEs on fish and other fish-eaters. A higher trophic level may imply biomagnification, and, for example, DDE shows concentration ratios in lipids of 110 (guillemot/ herring), 460 (WTSE/ herring) and 4.2 (WTSE/ guillemot). Banked, frozen guillemot eggs have been extensively used for retrospective temporal trend analyses for several chemicals. Ideally, the matrix should also be useful for biological effect monitoring. Eggshell and reproductive parameters are monitored in the WTSEs and guillemots. Reproductive problems and egg desiccation still occur among eagles, indicating an impact of contaminants and highlighting the importance of apex predators as environmental sentinels.

Biodiversity conservation: The key is reducing meat consumption	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Biodiversity loss; Livestock; Meat consumption; Climate change; Permaculture	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; CROP-ANIMAL SYSTEMS; LAND-USE CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; FOOD SECURITY; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; GLOBAL LIVESTOCK; FARMING SYSTEMS	The consumption of animal-sourced food products by humans is one of the most powerful negative forces affecting the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and biological diversity. Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides. Bushmeat consumption in Africa and southeastern Asia, as well as the high growth-rate of per capita livestock consumption in China are of special concern. The projected land base required by 2050 to support livestock production in several megadiverse countries exceeds 30-50% of their current agricultural areas. Livestock production is also a leading cause of climate change, soil loss, water and nutrient pollution, and decreases of apex predators and wild herbivores, compounding pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity. It is possible to greatly reduce the impacts of animal product consumption by humans on natural ecosystems and biodiversity while meeting nutritional needs of people, including the projected 2-3 billion people to be added to human population. We suggest that impacts can be remediated through several solutions: (1) reducing demand for animal-based food products and increasing proportions of plant-based foods in diets, the latter ideally to a global average of 90% of food consumed; (2) replacing ecologically-inefficient ruminants (e.g. cattle, goats, sheep) and bushmeat with monogastrics (e.g. poultry, pigs), integrated aquaculture, and other more-efficient protein sources; and (3) reintegrating livestock production away from single-product, intensive, fossil-fuel based systems into diverse, coupled systems designed more closely around the structure and functions of ecosystems that conserve energy and nutrients. Such efforts would also impart positive impacts on human health through reduction of diseases of nutritional extravagance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we examined the feeding ecology (diet composition and trophic level) and trophic relationships of 22 elasmobranchs (2 Carcharhiniformes, 1 Hexanchiformes, 1 Lamniformes, 3 Myliobatiformes, 6 Rajiformes, 6 Squaliformes and 3 Torpediniformes) present in the western Mediterranean Sea. To obtain a comprehensive view of the feeding ecology of these species, we combined different approaches: stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15 values), stomach content analyses and published sources. Our results revealed differences in feeding strategies among elasmobranch groups: skates (Rajiformes) mainly consume crustaceans; sharks (Carcharhiniformes, Hexanchiformes, Squaliformes and Lamniformes) prefer mixed diets composed of cephalopods, crustaceans and fishes; electric rays (Torpediniformes) feed mostly on fishes; and the diet of stingrays (Myliobatiformes) varies between species. Sharks and electric rays show higher trophic positions than skates, and the former occupy similar positions to other apex predators. Skates are more similar to other mesopredator fishes. These new findings offer essential information on the ecological role of several elasmobranchs in the western Mediterranean Sea and provide useful data for managers for future conservation strategies.

This once-abundant sea has witnessed major declines in apex predators, now largely restricted to isolated pockets within marine reserves. This depletion could critically impact macrophyte communities that are strongly structured by top-down processes. We evaluated rates of predation on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a key herbivore of macroalgal and Posidonia oceanica seagrass seascapes, across a large stretch of the Western Mediterranean coastline. Fish predation was generally higher inside reserves, but was equally high at several locations outside these boundaries. Although critically low at some locations compared to reserves, predation was functionally ubiquitous in most habitats, seasons and sites. Fish were still primarily responsible for this predation with no clear evidence of meso-predator release. Macroalgal habitats were consistently subject to higher predation than in seagrass meadows, functionally critical given the vulnerability of macroalgal systems to overgrazing. Predation hotspots were clearly associated with high fish predator numbers and low refuge availability. Taken together, these results suggest that long-term overfishing may not necessarily reflect a complete loss of trophic function. Pockets of fish predation may still persist, linked to habitat complexity, predator behavioral adaptations and landscape-level features. Given the essential role top-down control plays in macroalgal communities, regulating fishing at these predation hotspots is vital to effectively conserve habitats from future hysteretic shifts. Even historically fished seas may retain areas where trophic function persists; identifying these areas is critical to preserving the remaining ecological integrity of these coastlines.

Invasive carnivores alter ecological function and enhance complementarity in scavenger assemblages on ocean beaches	ECOLOGY			English	Article						birds of prey; food webs; foxes; functional traits; invasive species; raptors; sandy beaches; scavengers	TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; SANDY BEACHES; FOOD WEBS; RED FOX; MARINE; IMPACTS; CARRION; RESOURCES; SUBSIDIES; SEA	Species composition is expected to alter ecological function in assemblages if species traits differ strongly. Such effects are often large and persistent for nonnative carnivores invading islands. Alternatively, high similarity in traits within assemblages creates a degree of functional redundancy in ecosystems. Here we tested whether species turnover results in functional ecological equivalence or complementarity, and whether invasive carnivores on islands significantly alter such ecological function. The model system consisted of vertebrate scavengers (dominated by raptors) foraging on animal carcasses on ocean beaches on two Australian islands, one with and one without invasive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Partitioning of scavenging events among species, carcass removal rates, and detection speeds were quantified using camera traps baited with fish carcasses at the dune-beach interface. Complete segregation of temporal foraging niches between mammals (nocturnal) and birds (diurnal) reflects complementarity in carrion utilization. Conversely, functional redundancy exists within the bird guild where several species of raptors dominate carrion removal in a broadly similar way. As predicted, effects of red foxes were large. They substantially changed the nature and rate of the scavenging process in the system: (1) foxes consumed over half (55%) of all carrion available at night, compared with negligible mammalian foraging at night on the fox-free island, and (2) significant shifts in the composition of the scavenger assemblages consuming beach-cast carrion are the consequence of fox invasion at one island. Arguably, in the absence of other mammalian apex predators, the addition of red foxes creates a new dimension of functional complementarity in beach food webs. However, this functional complementarity added by foxes is neither benign nor neutral, as marine carrion subsidies to coastal red fox populations are likely to facilitate their persistence as exotic carnivores.

Large coastal jellyfish are major consumers of plankton in heavily fished ecosystems; yet, they are frequently not included as model components. We explore the relationship between gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) and the large scyphozoan jellyfish (Aurelia spp. and Chrysaora sp.), and provide an examination of trophic energy transfer pathways to higher trophic levels in the northern Gulf of Mexico. A trophic network model developed within the ECOPATH framework was transformed to an end-to-end model to map foodweb energy flows. Relative changes in functional group productivity to varying gulf menhaden consumption rates, jellyfish consumption rates, and forage fish (i.e. gulf menhaden, anchovies, and herrings) harvest rates were evaluated within a suite of static, alternative energy-demand scenarios using ECOTRAN techniques. Scenario analyses revealed forage fish harvest enhanced jellyfish productivity, which, in turn, depressed menhaden productivity. Modelled increases in forage fish harvest caused pronounced changes in ecosystem structure, affecting jellyfish, marine birds, piscivorous fish, and apex predators. Menhaden were found to be a more efficient and important energy transfer pathway to higher trophic levels compared with jellyfish. A simulated increase in jellyfish abundance caused the relative production of all model groups to decline. These outcomes suggest that jellyfish blooms and forage fish harvest have demonstrable effects on the structure of the northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.

However, the effects of overfishing and collapse of large top predators on the broad-scale biodiversity of oceanic ecosystems remain largely unexplored. Populations of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were overfished and several collapsed in the early 1990s across Atlantic Canada, providing a unique opportunity to study potential ecosystem-level effects of the reduction of a dominant predator on fish biodiversity, and to identify how such effects might interact with other environmental factors, such as changes in climate, over time. We combined causal modelling with model selection and multimodel inference to analyse 41years of fishery-independent survey data (1970-2010) and quantify ecosystem-level effects of overfishing and climate variation on the biodiversity of fishes across a broad area (172000km(2)) of the Scotian Shelf. We found that alpha and beta diversity increased with decreases in cod occurrence; fish communities were less homogeneous and more variable in systems where cod no longer dominated. These effects were most pronounced in the colder north-eastern parts of the Scotian Shelf. Our results provide strong evidence that intensive harvesting (and collapse) of marine apex predators can have large impacts on biodiversity, with far-reaching consequences for ecological stability across an entire ecosystem.

Using Satellite Tracking and Isotopic Information to Characterize the Impact of South American Sea Lions on Salmonid Aquaculture in Southern Chile	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NORTHERN FUR SEALS; OTARIA-FLAVESCENS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; FORAGING STRATEGIES; FEEDING ECOLOGY; MIXING MODELS; INDIVIDUAL VARIATION; DIET SPECIALIZATION; EUMETOPIAS-JUBATUS; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT	Apex marine predators alter their foraging behavior in response to spatial and/or seasonal changes in natural prey distribution and abundance. However, few studies have identified the impacts of aquaculture that represents a spatially and temporally predictable and abundant resource on their foraging behavior. Using satellite telemetry and stable isotope analysis we examined the degree of spatial overlap between the South American sea lion (SASL) and salmon farms, and quantify the amount of native prey versus farmed salmonids in SASL diets. We instrumented eight SASL individuals with SRDL-GPS tags. Vibrissae, hair and skin samples were collected for delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses from five of the tagged individuals and from four males captured in a haul-out located adjacent to salmon farms. Tracking results showed that almost all the foraging areas of SASL are within close proximity to salmon farms. The most important prey for the individuals analyzed was farmed salmonids, with an estimated median (+/- SD) contribution of 19.7 +/- 13.5% and 15.3 +/- 9.6% for hair and skin, respectively. Using vibrissae as a temporal record of diet for each individual, we observed a remarkable switch in diet composition in two SASL, from farmed salmonids to pelagic fishes, which coincided with the decrease of salmon production due to the infectious salmon anemia virus that affected salmon farms in Chile at the end of 2008. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of integrating stable isotope derived dietary data with movement patterns to characterize the impacts of a non-native prey on the foraging ecology of an apex marine predator, providing important applied implications in situations where interactions between aquaculture and wildlife are common.

For example, characterizing dietary patterns of generalist apex predators in the past and present can help to define how their functional role may change as translocated populations grow. We identified prey remains collected from Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nests and used carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analysis to quantify diet composition of the recently reintroduced Bald Eagle population on the Channel Islands off southern California, USA. We collected >6,000 prey items from recently occupied nests on Santa Catalina, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa islands in 2010 and 2011. Prey identification and stable isotope analysis yielded similar results and showed that eagles on Santa Catalina Island consumed a high proportion (similar to 60%) of marine fish and a lower proportion (25-30%) of seabirds, while their counterparts on the Northern Channel Islands consumed equal proportions (similar to 40-45%) of these prey types. Terrestrial resource use was low with the exception of eagles from one nest on Santa Catalina Island, where eagles primarily consumed ground squirrels and freshwater fish. We suggest that a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors is responsible for the interisland differences in Bald Eagle diet. Bald Eagle interactions with a robust recreational fishery off Santa Catalina Island may enhance access to fish species that are not available to eagles on the Northern Channel Islands, where the availability of breeding seabirds is far greater. The proportion of seabirds consumed by eagles on the Northern Channel Islands today is similar to that consumed by eagles from this region historically and prehistorically. This suggests that the restoration of breeding seabirds on the Channel Islands will benefit the long-term viability of eagle populations in the northern archipelago.

Evaluating the landscape of fear between apex predatory sharks and mobile sea turtles across a large dynamic seascape	ECOLOGY			English	Article						biotelemetry; Caretta caretta; ecology of fear; ecosystem; Galeocerdo cuvier; landscape of fear; predation risk; predator-prey interactions; satellite tagging; sharks; trophic cascades; turtles	HABITAT USE; LOGGERHEAD TURTLES; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; TIGER SHARK; MARINE PREDATOR; ROE DEER; RISK; PREY; IMPACTS; VULNERABILITY	The "landscape of fear'' model has been proposed as a unifying concept in ecology, describing, in part, how animals behave and move about in their environment. The basic model predicts that as an animal's landscape changes from low to high risk of predation, prey species will alter their behavior to risk avoidance. However, studies investigating and evaluating the landscape of fear model across large spatial scales (tens to hundreds of thousands of square kilometers) in dynamic, open, aquatic systems involving apex predators and highly mobile prey are lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated predatorprey relationships between tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) in the North Atlantic Ocean. This included the use of satellite tracking to examine shark and turtle distributions as well as their surfacing behaviors under varying levels of home range overlap. Our findings revealed patterns that deviated from our a priori predictions based on the landscape of fear model. Specifically, turtles did not alter their surfacing behaviors to risk avoidance when overlap in shark-turtle core home range was high. However, in areas of high overlap with turtles, sharks exhibited modified surfacing behaviors that may enhance predation opportunity. We suggest that turtles may be an important factor in determining shark distribution, whereas for turtles, other life history trade-offs may play a larger role in defining their habitat use. We propose that these findings are a result of both biotic and physically driven factors that independently or synergistically affect predator-prey interactions in this system. These results have implications for evolutionary biology, community ecology, and wildlife conservation. Further, given the difficulty in studying highly migratory marine species, our approach and conclusions may be applied to the study of other predatorprey systems.

Feeding in the field is poorly known; however, isolates of an Antarctic M. rubrum strain are maintained in culture on a diet of Teleaulex/Plagioselmis/Geminigera-like cryptophytes, suggesting that cryptophyte presence may be an important factor controlling M. rubrum distribution and abundance in nature. We augmented field surveys with published findings to establish the distribution of both M. rubrum and a Geminigera-like cryptophyte in a range of East Antarctic aquatic environments. We also studied their overwinter abundances in Ace Lake to determine whether a predator-prey relationship existed between the two species in this natural enclosed ecosystem. The ciliate and the cryptophyte co-occurred in the majority of sites sampled which ranged widely in salinity (2.2-150 aEuro degrees) and temperature (-3.0-16 A degrees C). We observed a cyclic relationship in species abundances in Ace Lake, implying population growth for M. rubrum responded to changed cryptophyte abundance. Mesodinium rubrum likely exerts top-down pressure on cryptophyte abundances in natural enclosed ecosystems especially under low-light winter conditions. The ciliate can be considered an apex predator in highly truncated food webs.

J	Yakovis, E; Artemieva, A				Yakovis, Eugeniy; Artemieva, Anna			Bored to Death: Community-Wide Effect of Predation on a Foundation Species in a Low-Disturbance Arctic Subtidal System	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WHITE SEA; LATITUDINAL VARIATION; BARNACLES; RECRUITMENT; ASCIDIANS; DIET; PREY; COMPETITION; AGGREGATIONS; GASTROPODA	The strength of top-down control by consumers is predicted to decrease with latitude, but most data confirming this assumption come from latitudes <60 degrees, while empirical studies of predation in sub-arctic and arctic marine habitats are few. A barnacle Balanus crenatus is a native foundation species in the shallow subtidal of the White Sea (65 degrees N), hosting a diverse (250+ species) assemblage of macrobenthic organisms. On mixed sediments live barnacles share primary substrates (shells and gravel) with numerous empty barnacle tests, 7% of which had drill holes of an unidentified origin. We manipulated the densities of (i) adult muricid whelks Boreotrophon clathratus (of previously unknown feeding habits), to check if they prey on barnacles, (ii) other predators to reveal their effect on juvenile Boreotrophon, and (iii) empty tests to assess the community-wide effect of predation on barnacles. The abundance of drilled empty tests in the field correlated with that of Boreotrophon. A year-long caging experiment clearly confirmed predation, showing the highest barnacle mortality and proportion of drilled tests in whelk enclosures, and the lowest-in predator exclosure treatments. Boreotrophon preferred the barnacles attached to conspecifics to those from primary substrates. Because of its scarcity Boreotrophon had a minor direct effect on barnacle abundance in the field. Yet, initially defaunated empty tests and live barnacles developed markedly different macrobenthic assemblages, suggesting a strong indirect effect of the predation. Juvenile Boreotrophon were 5-6 times less abundant in open and partial cages than in exclosures and enclosures, which indicates that the recruitment and, consequently, the abundance of Boreotrophon and its predation on Balanus are top-down controlled by apex predators. In contrast, in tropical and temperate intertidal the predation on barnacles is stronger and primarily limited by environmental stress and prey availability.

Long-term (1993-2013) changes in macrozooplankton off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS			English	Article						Southern Ocean; Krill; Zooplankton; Climate; Sea ice	KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; ISLANDS SOUTHERN-OCEAN; SEA-ICE; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FOOD-WEB; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS	The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, and where a high apex predator biomass is supported in large part by macrozooplankton. We examined trends in summer (January-February) abundance of major taxa of macrozooplankton along the WAP over two decades (1993-2013) and their relationship with environmental parameters (sea ice, atmospheric climate indices, sea surface temperature, and phytoplankton biomass and productivity). Macrozooplankton were collected from the top 120 m of the water column in a mid-Peninsula study region divided into latitudinal (North, South, and Far South) and cross-shelf (coastal, shelf, slope) sub-regions. Trends for krill species included a 5-year cycle in abundance peaks (positive anomalies) for Euphausia superba, but no directional long-term trend, and an increase in Thysanoessa macrura in the North; variability in both species was strongly influenced by primary production 2-years prior. E. crystallorophias abundance was best explained by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI), and was more abundant in higher ice conditions. The salp Salpa thompsoni and thecosome pteropod Limacina helicina cycled between negative and positive anomalies in the North, but showed increasing positive anomalies in the South over time. Variation in salp and pteropod abundance was best explained by SAM and the MEI, respectively, and both species were more abundant in lower ice conditions. There was a long-term increase in some carnivorous gelatinous zooplankton (polychaete worm Tomopteris spp.) and amphipods. Abundance of Pseudosagitta spp. chaetognaths was closely related to SAM, with higher abundance tied to lower ice conditions. Longterm changes and sub-decadal cycles of WAP macrozooplankton community composition may affect energy transfer to higher trophic levels, and alter biogeochemical cycling in this seasonally productive and sensitive polar ecosystem.

Low recapture rates are typical in many study systems including fishing-based studies. Incorporating auxiliary data into the models can improve precision and in some cases enable parameter estimation. Here, we present a novel application of acoustic telemetry for the estimation of apparent survival and abundance within capture-mark-recapture analysis using open population models. Our case study is based on simultaneously collecting longline fishing and acoustic telemetry data for a large mobile apex predator, the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus), at a coastal site in Tasmania, Australia. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models showed that longline data alone had very low recapture rates while acoustic telemetry data for the same time period resulted in at least tenfold higher recapture rates. The apparent survival estimates were similar for the two datasets but the acoustic telemetry data showed much greater precision and enabled apparent survival parameter estimation for one dataset, which was inestimable using fishing data alone. Combined acoustic telemetry and longline data were incorporated into Jolly-Seber models using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Abundance estimates were comparable to those with longline data only; however, the inclusion of acoustic telemetry data increased precision in the estimates. We conclude that acoustic telemetry is a useful tool for incorporating in capture-mark-recapture studies in the marine environment. Future studies should consider the application of acoustic telemetry within this framework when setting up the study design and sampling program.

Variation in whole-, landed- and trimmed-carcass and fin-weight ratios for various sharks captured on demersal set-lines off eastern Australia	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Sharks; Elasmobranchs; Body weight; Fin	CONSERVATION; CONSEQUENCES; DECLINES; CATCHES; RAYS	Sharks are important apex predators in marine systems but many populations have experienced large declines, which has resulted in adverse effects on marine food webs. Sharks are also economically important, as their fins are valued in Asian markets. In response to concerns about declining shark populations, a number of nations, including Australia, have developed national plans of action for their conservation and management. As part of New South Wales' (NSW) efforts to understand the characteristics of their shark fishery, data were collected on the depth of capture, species, sex, body length and weight, fin weight, and reproductive status of individuals caught in the NSW commercial 'large shark' demersal set-line fishery. We created models of the relationship between fin to body weight and wastage (discarded or low value portions of the carcass) and compared the ratios of whole, landed, trimmed, and fin weight to determine the relationship between fin weight and wastage to length by species. Our results indicate that length, sex, and the interactions between length with species and sex account for differences in the relative fin weight of sharks; whereas species, length, and their interaction account for differences in the proportion of a shark carcass that is wasted. The data reveal that catching smaller sharks will increase relative fin weight and decrease wastage. Given these results, we recommend that managers consider weight ratio data information in their decision making to promote a sustainable and profitable shark fishery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Diet shift and site-fidelity of oceanic whitetip sharks Carcharhinus longimanus along the Great Bahama Bank	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Stable isotope; Elasmobranch; Endangered; Tag; Pelagic; Bayesian mixing model	FINNED PILOT WHALES; APEX MARINE PREDATOR; STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; RHINCODON-TYPUS; CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; DISCRIMINATION FACTORS; MIGRATION PATTERNS; NIGHTTIME BEHAVIOR; GLOBICEPHALA MELAS	Identifying the driving forces behind oceanic pelagic shark movements is key to a better understanding of their life history. Some oceanic pelagic shark species have been shown to aggregate in specific regions to mate and/or exploit abundant food resources. The oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus, a subtropical, ectothermic, oceanic pelagic shark that has experienced severe population declines, aggregates seasonally around Cat Island (CI) in The Bahamas. Large pelagic teleosts (e. g. billfish, tunas, and dolphinfish) are abundant in this region and oceanic whitetips are anecdotally reported to feed heavily on recreationally caught teleosts. However, it was unknown whether feeding habits at CI substantially differ from longer-term feeding habits. We used tag-recapture to assess site-fidelity of adult oceanic whitetips to CI and stable isotope analysis (SIA) of 2 different tissues (blood plasma and white muscle) to compare short-and long-term feeding patterns. The relatively high recapture rate (20.3%) confirmed that individual whitetips exhibit site-fidelity to CI. The aggregation consisted of adult individuals; females were more common, more than half were gravid, and no physical or behavioral evidence of mating or parturition was observed at CI. SIA-based Bayesian mixing model estimates of short-term (near CI) diets showed more large pelagic teleosts (72%) than in long-term diets (47%), showing a spatiotemporal difference in oceanic whitetip feeding habits. This suggests that availability of large teleost prey is a possible mechanism underpinning site-fidelity and aggregation of whitetips at CI. These results provide insight into the function of one of the last known aggregations of this once-abundant top predator.

Body-size trends of the extinct giant shark Carcharocles megalodon: a deep-time perspective on marine apex predators	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							FOSSIL RECORD; RANDOM-WALKS; WHITE SHARK; EVOLUTION; STASIS; SELECTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; PATTERNS; MODELS; PANAMA	The extinct shark Carcharocles megalodon is one of the largest marine apex predators ever to exist. Nonetheless, little is known about its body-size variations through time and space. Here, we studied the body-size trends of C. megalodon through its temporal and geographic range to better understand its ecology and evolution. Given that this species was the last of the megatooth lineage, a group of species that shows a purported size increase through time, we hypothesized that C. megalodon also displayed this trend, increasing in size over time and reaching its largest size prior to extinction. We found that C. megalodon body-size distribution was left-skewed (suggesting a long-term selective pressure favoring larger individuals), and presented significant geographic variation (possibly as a result of the heterogeneous ecological constraints of this cosmopolitan species) over geologic time. Finally, we found that stasis was the general mode of size evolution of C. megalodon (i.e., no net changes over time), contrasting with the trends of the megatooth lineage and our hypothesis. Given that C. megalodon is a relatively long-lived species with a widely distributed fossil record, we further used this study system to provide a deep-time perspective to the understanding of the body-size trends of marine apex predators. For instance, our results suggest that (1) a selective pressure in predatory sharks for consuming a broader range of prey may favor larger individuals and produce left-skewed distributions on a geologic time scale; (2) body-size variations in cosmopolitan apex marine predators may depend on their interactions with geographically discrete communities; and (3) the inherent characteristics of shark species can produce stable sizes over geologic time, regardless of the size trends of their lineages.

Isolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers from a globally distributed marine apex predator, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Tiger shark; Galeocerdo cuvier; Microsatellite; Elasmobranch genetics		High levels of fishing have resulted in declines among many of the oceans top predators, including the globally distributed tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Overexploitation of this species has led to declines in parts of its distribution, which may have important ecological consequences given the tiger shark's trophic position as a large bodied, generalist predator. To assess the population genetics of this species, an enrichment protocol was used to isolate a suite of nine di- and tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci within the tiger shark, which were subsequently characterized using genomic DNA derived from 40 individuals sampled from Hawaiian waters. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 23, and the average expected heterozygosities across loci ranged from 0.30 to 0.93. Analyses suggested a low frequency of null alleles across markers, and all loci conformed to both Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium at P > 0.01.	[Bernard, A. M.; Shivji, M.

Using non-systematic surveys to investigate effects of regional climate variability on Australasian gannets in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH			English	Article						Seabirds; Climate variability; Apex predators; Hauraki Gulf; New Zealand	DATA ASSIMILATION ANALYSIS; DOLPHINS DELPHINUS SP.; UPPER OCEAN 1950-95; MORUS-SERRATOR; SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; COMMERCIAL FISHERIES; SARDINOPS-SAGAX; PACIFIC-OCEAN; SEABIRDS; IMPACTS	Few studies have investigated regional and natural climate variability on seabird populations using ocean reanalysis datasets (e.g. Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA)) that integrate atmospheric information to supplement ocean observations and provide improved estimates of ocean conditions. Herein we use a non-systematic dataset on Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) from 2001 to 2009 to identify potential connections between Gannet Sightings Per Unit Effort (GSPUE) and climate and oceanographic variability in a region of known importance for breeding seabirds, the Hauraki Gulf (HG), New Zealand. While no statistically significant relationships between GSPUE and global climate indices were determined, there was a significant correlation between GSPUE and regional SST anomaly for HG. Also, there appears to be a strong link between global climate indices and regional climate in the HG. Further, based on cross-correlation function coefficients and lagged multiple regression models, we identified potential leading and lagging climate variables, and climate variables but with limited predictive capacity in forecasting future GSPUE. Despite significant inter-annual variability and marginally cooler SSTs since 2001, gannet sightings appear to be increasing. We hypothesize that at present underlying physical changes in the marine ecosystem may be insufficient to affect supply of preferred gannet main prey (pilchard Sardinops spp.), which tolerate a wide thermal range. Our study showcases the potential scientific value of lengthy non-systematic data streams and when designed properly (i.e., contain abundance, flock size, and spatial data), can yield useful information in climate impact studies on seabirds and other marine fauna. Such information can be invaluable for enhancing conservation measures for protected species in fiscally constrained research environments. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Vertical habitat and behaviour of the bluntnose sixgill shark in Hawaii	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article						Hexanchus griseus; Satellite telemetry; Vertical migrations; Slope environment; Oxygen minimum layer	SATELLITE ARCHIVAL TAGS; OCEAN TIME-SERIES; HEXANCHUS-GRISEUS; DEEP-SEA; PACIFIC-OCEAN; ALOPIAS-SUPERCILIOSUS; ACOUSTIC TRACKING; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; XIPHIAS-GLADIUS; MARINE FISHES	Bluntnose sixgill sharks are apex predators and scavengers that are near-globally distributed in slope and shelf habitats, but many aspects of their behaviour and ecology are poorly understood. A better understanding of how oceanographic variables influence sixgill shark behaviour may help predict their distribution, response to increasing anthropogenic stressors including climate change, and role in ecosystems throughout their geographic range. We used satellite telemetry to observe the vertical behaviour of four bluntnose sixgill sharks in the subtropical oligotrophic waters of Hawaii. A strong diel vertical movement cycle was observed, with sharks spending nighttime in thermocline waters and descending into the oxygen minimum zone in daytime. Depth changes generally occurred between nautical twilight and sunrise/sunset. Dive initiation and dive completion were significantly correlated with nautical dawn and sunrise, respectively. A stepwise generalised estimating equations model was used to investigate vertical speeds in the daytime and nighttime depth habitats, and this analysis revealed that photic zone light level was the primary factor correlated with vertical speed. Outside of the depth transitions, higher vertical speeds were observed when photic zone light was low, suggesting more active foraging in the shallow nighttime habitat than the deep daytime habitat.

Genetic Diversity of White Sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, in the Northwest Atlantic and Southern Africa	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY			English	Article						bottleneck; effective population size Ne; inbreeding	EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; ALLELE FREQUENCY DATA; GULF-OF-MEXICO; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; ANADROMOUS FISHES; FRESH-WATER; MARINE; SOFTWARE; PHILOPATRY	The white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, is both one of the largest apex predators in the world and among the most heavily protected marine fish. Population genetic diversity is in part shaped by recent demographic history and can thus provide information complementary to more traditional population assessments, which are difficult to obtain for white sharks and have at times been controversial. Here, we use the mitochondrial control region and 14 nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci to assess white shark genetic diversity in 2 regions: the Northwest Atlantic (NWA, N = 35) and southern Africa (SA, N = 131). We find that these 2 regions harbor genetically distinct white shark populations (I broken vertical bar (ST) = 0.10, P < 0.00001; microsatellite F (ST) = 0.1057, P < 0.021). M-ratios were low and indicative of a genetic bottleneck in the NWA (M-ratio = 0.71, P < 0.004) but not SA (M-ratio = 0.85, P = 0.39). This is consistent with other evidence showing a steep population decline occurring in the mid to late 20th century in the NWA, whereas the SA population appears to have been relatively stable. Estimates of effective population size ranged from 22.6 to 66.3 (NWA) and 188 to 1998.3 (SA) and evidence of inbreeding was found (primarily in NWA). Overall, our findings indicate that white population dynamics within NWA and SA are determined more by intrinsic reproduction than immigration and there is genetic evidence of a population decline in the NWA, further justifying the strong domestic protective measures that have been taken for this species in this region. Our study also highlights how assessment of genetic diversity can complement other sources of information to better understand the status of threatened marine fish populations.

Factors affecting individual foraging specialization and temporal diet stability across the range of a large "generalist" apex predator	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						American alligator; Alligator mississippiensis; Stomach content analysis; Stable isotope analysis; Food web	NORTH-CENTRAL FLORIDA; NICHE WIDTH; AMERICAN ALLIGATORS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; PREY SELECTION; KILLER WHALES; FOOD-HABITS; SEA OTTERS; PATTERNS; LAKE	Individual niche specialization (INS) is increasingly recognized as an important component of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. However, most studies that have investigated INS have focused on the effects of niche width and inter-and intraspecific competition on INS in small-bodied species for short time periods, with less attention paid to INS in large-bodied reptilian predators and the effects of available prey types on INS. We investigated the prevalence, causes, and consequences of INS in foraging behaviors across different populations of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), the dominant aquatic apex predator across the southeast US, using stomach contents and stable isotopes. Gut contents revealed that, over the short term, although alligator populations occupied wide ranges of the INS spectrum, general patterns were apparent. Alligator populations inhabiting lakes exhibited lower INS than coastal populations, likely driven by variation in habitat type and available prey types. Stable isotopes revealed that over longer time spans alligators exhibited remarkably consistent use of variable mixtures of carbon pools (e.g., marine and freshwater food webs). We conclude that INS in large-bodied reptilian predator populations is likely affected by variation in available prey types and habitat heterogeneity, and that INS should be incorporated into management strategies to efficiently meet intended goals. Also, ecological models, which typically do not consider behavioral variability, should include INS to increase model realism and applicability.

Because of their high trophic position, auks are at risk from high contaminant burdens that bioaccumulate and biomagnify, and could therefore pose a toxicological risk to human consumers. We analysed trace element concentrations from breast muscle of 51 auks collected off Newfoundland in the 2011-2012 hunting season. There were few differences in contaminant concentrations among species. In total, 14 (27%) exceeded Health Canada or international guidelines for arsenic, lead, or cadmium; none exceeded guidelines for mercury. Cadmium concentrations >0.05 mu g/g have persisted in Newfoundland murres for the last 25 years. We urge the integration of this consumptive harvest for high-trophic marine predators into periodic human health risk assessments. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Their success as apex predators has been attributed to their rapid acquisition of aquatic adaptations, which allowed them to become fully pelagic. However, little is known about the breeding biology of derived, flipper-bearing mosasaurs, as the record of neonatal mosasaur fossils is extremely sparse. Here, we report on the fragmentary cranial remains of two neonatal mosasaurs from the Niobrara Formation, referred to Clidastes sp. Comparison with other preliminary reports of neonatal mosasaurs reveals that these specimens are among the smallest individuals ever found and certainly represent the smallest known Clidastes specimens. The recovery of these extremely young specimens from a pelagic setting indicates that even neonatal mosasaurs occupied open oceanic habitats and were likely born in this setting. These data shed new light on the ecology of neonatal mosasaurs and illustrate the degree to which size-related taphonomic and collection biases have influenced our understanding of the early life history of these iconic marine reptiles.

Rapidly increasing methyl mercury in endangered ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea) feathers over a 130 year record	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						delta C-13; delta N-15; Arctic; mercury; stable isotopes; threatened species	SEABIRD FEATHERS; LINEAR-REGRESSION; STABLE-ISOTOPES; BIRD FEATHERS; GLOBAL CHANGE; ARCTIC BIOTA; METHYLMERCURY; EXPOSURE; MOLT; PREDATOR	Mercury (Hg) is increasing in marine food webs, especially at high latitudes. The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of methyl mercury (MeHg) has serious effects on wildlife, and is most evident in apex predators. The MeHg body burden in birds is the balance of ingestion and excretion, and MeHg in feathers is an effective indicator of overall MeHg burden. Ivory gulls (Pagophila eburnea), which consume ice-associated prey and scavenge marine mammal carcasses, have the highest egg Hg concentrations of any Arctic bird, and the species has declined by more than 80% since the 1980s in Canada. We used feathers from museum specimens from the Canadian Arctic and western Greenland to assess whether exposure to MeHg by ivory gulls increased from 1877 to 2007. Based on constant feather stable-isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) values, there was no significant change in ivory gulls' diet over this period, but feather MeHg concentrations increased 45x (from 0.09 to 4.11 mu g g(-1) in adults). This dramatic change in the absence of a dietary shift is clear evidence of the impact of anthropogenic Hg on this high-latitude threatened species. Bioavailable Hg is expected to increase in the Arctic, raising concern for continued population declines in high-latitude species that are far from sources of environmental contaminants.

Biomass-based targets and the management of multispecies coral reef fisheries	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						ecosystem function; Indian Ocean; life-history traits; resource management; sustainable fisheries; wilderness	UNDERWATER VISUAL-CENSUS; ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; REFERENCE POINTS; MARINE RESERVES; ESCAPE GAPS; FISH; RESPONSES; SUSTAINABILITY; EXPLOITATION; COMMUNITIES	The failure of fisheries management among multispecies coral reef fisheries is well documented and has dire implications for the 100 million people engaged in these small-scale operations. Weak or missing management institutions, a lack of research capacity, and the complex nature of these ecosystems have heralded a call for ecosystem-based management approaches. However, ecosystem-based management of coral reef fisheries has proved challenging due to the multispecies nature of catches and the diversity of fish functional roles. We used data on fish communities collected from 233 individual sites in 9 western Indian Ocean countries to evaluate changes in the site's functional composition and associated life-history characteristics along a large range of fish biomass. As biomass increased along this range, fish were larger and grew and matured more slowly while the abundance of scraping and predatory species increased. The greatest changes in functional composition occurred below relatively low standing stock biomass (<600 kg/ha); abundances of piscivores, apex predators, and scraping herbivores were low at very light levels of fishing. This suggests potential trade-offs in ecosystem function and estimated yields for different management systems. Current fishing gear and area restrictions are not achieving conservation targets (proposed here as standing stock biomass of 1150 kg/ha) and result in losses of life history and ecological functions. Fish in reefs where destructive gears were restricted typically had very similar biomass and functions to young and low compliance closures. This indicates the potentially important role of fisheries restrictions in providing some gains in biomass and associated ecological functions when fully protected area enforcement potential is limited and likely to fail. Our results indicate that biomass alone can provide broad ecosystem-based fisheries management targets that can be easily applied even where research capacity and information is limited. Of particular value, is our finding that current management tools may be used to reach key ecosystem-based management targets, enabling ecosystem-based management in many socioeconomic contexts.

Impact of conservation areas on trophic interactions between apex predators and herbivores on coral reefs	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						ecosystem function; Great Barrier Reef; herbivory; marine reserve; reef shark; top-down control; trophic structure	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SHARK TRIAENODON-OBESUS; MARINE FOOD WEBS; NO-TAKE AREAS; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS; TOP PREDATORS; PHASE-SHIFTS; BODY-SIZE	Apex predators are declining at alarming rates due to exploitation by humans, but we have yet to fully discern the impacts of apex predator loss on ecosystem function. In a management context, it is critically important to clarify the role apex predators play in structuring populations of lower trophic levels. Thus, we examined the top-down influence of reef sharks (an apex predator on coral reefs) and mesopredators on large-bodied herbivores. We measured the abundance, size structure, and biomass of apex predators, mesopredators, and herbivores across fished, no-take, and no-entry management zones in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Shark abundance and mesopredator size and biomass were higher in no-entry zones than in fished and no-take zones, which indicates the viability of strictly enforced human exclusion areas as tools for the conservation of predator communities. Changes in predator populations due to protection in no-entry zones did not have a discernible influence on the density, size, or biomass of different functional groups of herbivorous fishes. The lack of a relationship between predators and herbivores suggests that top-down forces may not play a strong role in regulating large-bodied herbivorous coral reef fish populations. Given this inconsistency with traditional ecological theories of trophic cascades, trophic structures on coral reefs may need to be reassessed to enable the establishment of appropriate and effective management regimes.

The potential of cholinesterases as tools for biomonitoring studies with sharks: Biochemical characterization in brain and muscle tissues of Prionace glauca	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Biomarker; Blue shark; Pollution; Chlorpyrifos-oxon	LIPID-PEROXIDATION LEVELS; FRESH-WATER FISH; NW MEDITERRANEAN SEA; IN-VITRO INHIBITION; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY; ESTUARINE FISH; NEUROTOXIC CONTAMINATION; GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS; ESTERASE-ACTIVITIES; RISK-ASSESSMENT	Cholinesterases (ChE) are a family of enzymes that play an essential role in neuronal and motor functions. Because of the susceptibility of these enzymes to anticholinergic agents and to other contaminants, their activity is frequently used as biomarker in pollution monitoring studies. The three known types of ChE in fish are acetilcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and propionylcholinesterase (PChE). The presence of these enzymes in each tissue differs between species, and thus their usage as biomarkers requires previous enzyme characterization. Sharks, mostly acting as apex predators, help maintain the balance of fish populations performing a key role in the ecosystem. Blue sharks (Prionace glauca) are one of the most abundant and heavily fished sharks in the world, thus being good candidate organisms for ecotoxicology and biomonitoring studies. The present study aimed to characterize the ChE present in the brain and muscle of the blue shark using different substrates and selective inhibitors, and to assess the in vitro sensitivity of these sharks' ChE to chlorpyrifos-oxon, a metabolite of a commonly used organophosphorous pesticide, recognized as a model anticholinesterase contaminant. The results suggest that the brain of P. glauca seems to contain atypical ChEs, displaying mixed properties of AChE and BChE, and that the muscle tissue seems to contain mainly AChE. In vitro exposures to chloropyrifos-oxon inhibited blue shark's ChE in both tissues, the brain being the most sensitive tissue and therefore the most suitable for detection of exposure to low concentrations of anticholinergic compounds in the environment. This study indicates that ChE activity in blue sharks has the potential to be used as a sensitive and reliable biomarker in marine biomonitoring programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, sharks are being heavily overfished compromising the health of the world's reefs and pelagic environments. Although Indonesia is the world's largest and most diverse coral reef ecosystem, information on the exploitation of sharks in this region is scarce. Results of DNA barcoding of shark fin revealed two alarming findings: (1) a rarity of reef sharks that should dominate Indonesia's coastal ecosystems, and (2) a fishery that targets endangered sharks. The diversity and number of threatened species recovered in this study highlights the urgent need for improved regulation and control of Indonesia's shark fishery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Behavioural drivers of the ecological roles and importance of marine mammals	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Review						Marine mammals; Risk effects; Behaviourally mediated indirect interactions; BMII; Nutrient transport; Behavioural facilitation	BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS; TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES; SOUTHWEST INDIAN-OCEAN; SEALS PHOCA-VITULINA; STENELLA-LONGIROSTRIS; TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS; SEAGRASS ECOSYSTEM; HARBOR PORPOISES	Marine mammals feed at a variety of trophic levels, occur from freshwater to open-ocean ecosystems and are found across virtually all latitudes. Due to their high historical, and sometimes present-day, abundances, capability for large-scale movements and high metabolic rates, they have the potential to affect the structure and function of ecosystems through a variety of mechanisms over both ecological and evolutionary time. Usually, the effects of marine mammals on ecosystems are explicitly or implicitly considered to occur through their ability to remove prey through direct predation. Recent empirical studies and a rich theoretical framework, however, demonstrate that marine mammals can affect ecosystems through more diverse pathways, including those that are driven by marine mammal behaviour. Thus, non-consumptive effects of and on marine mammals may be critical in shaping their ecological importance. Non-consumptive effects may include risk effects, whereby predators induce costly changes to prey behaviour that impact prey population sizes or the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of prey impacts on communities (e.g. behaviour-mediated trophic cascades). Changes in the abundance of large apex predators (both marine mammals and sharks) and the introduction of perceived and real risks (human disturbance) may also affect behaviours of marine mammals and their prey that cascade to the wider ecosystem; the conditions under which such cascading effects might be most important, however, remain poorly understood. Other behaviour-driven ecological roles of marine mammals may include foraging tactics that facilitate the foraging of other species (especially seabirds), translocating nutrients and linking the dynamics of spatially distinct food webs.

Growth of a deep-water, predatory fish is influenced by the productivity of a boundary current system	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; LEEUWIN CURRENT; POLYPRION-OXYGENEIOS; MARINE; OCEAN; TEMPERATURE; AMERICANUS; ECOSYSTEMS; ATLANTIC	The effects of climate change on predatory fishes in deep shelf areas are difficult to predict because complex processes may govern food availability and temperature at depth. We characterised the net impact of recent environmental changes on hapuku (Polyprion oxygeneios), an apex predator found in continental slope habitats (>200 m depth) by using dendrochronology techniques to develop a multi-decadal record of growth from otoliths. Fish were sampled off temperate south-western Australia, a region strongly influenced by the Leeuwin Current, a poleward-flowing, eastern boundary current. The common variance among individual growth records was relatively low (3.4%), but the otolith chronology was positively correlated (r = 0.61, p < 0.02) with sea level at Fremantle, a proxy for the strength of the Leeuwin Current. The Leeuwin Current influences the primary productivity of shelf ecosystems, with a strong current favouring growth in hapuku. Leeuwin Current strength is predicted to decline under climate change models and this study provides evidence that associated productivity changes may flow through to higher trophic levels even in deep water habitats.

Markov models and network analysis reveal sex-specific differences in the space-use of a coastal apex predator	OIKOS			English	Article							SHARK NOTORYNCHUS-CEPEDIANUS; SEVENGILL SHARKS; CHAIN ANALYSIS; BLUEFIN TUNA; MOVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY; BROADNOSE; HABITAT; CONSERVATION	Understanding the links between external variables such as habitat and interactions with conspecifics and animal space-use is fundamental to developing effective management measures. In the marine realm, automated acoustic tracking has become a widely used method for monitoring the movement of free-ranging animals, yet researchers generally lack robust methods for analysing the resulting spatial-usage data. In this study, acoustic tracking data from male and female broadnose sevengill sharks Notorynchus cepedianus, collected in a system of coastal embayments in southeast Tasmania were analyzed to examine sex-specific differences in the sharks' coastal space-use and test novel methods for the analysis of acoustic telemetry data. Sex-specific space-use of the broadnose sevengill shark from acoustic telemetry data was analysed in two ways: The recently proposed spatial network analysis of between-receiver movements was employed to identify sex-specific space-use patterns. To include the full breadth of temporal information held in the data, movements between receivers were furthermore considered as transitions between states of a Markov chain, with the resulting transition probability matrix allowing the ranking of the relative importance of different parts of the study area. Both spatial network and Markov chain analysis revealed sex-specific preferences of different sites within the study area. The identification of priority areas differed for the methods, due to the fact that in contrast to network analysis, our Markov chain approach preserves the chronological sequence of detections and accounts for both residency periods and movements. In addition to adding to our knowledge of the ecology of a globally distributed apex predator, this study presents a promising new step towards condensing the vast amounts of information collected with acoustic tracking technology into straightforward results which are directly applicable to the management and conservation of any species that meet the assumptions of our model.

Setting the stage for a global-scale trophic analysis of marine top predators: a multi-workshop review	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES			English	Article						Tuna trophic ecology; Top predators; Global diet data; Global stable isotope data; Global nitrogen model; Predictive analyses; Climate change	WESTERN INDIAN-OCEAN; EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC; TUNA THUNNUS-ALBACARES; SYSTEM CLIMATE MODEL; YELLOWFIN TUNA; ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE; PELAGIC FISHES; ATLANTIC-OCEAN; NORTH PACIFIC; FEEDING ECOLOGY	Global-scale studies of marine food webs are rare, despite their necessity for examining and understanding ecosystem level effects of climate variability. Here we review the progress of an international collaboration that compiled regional diet datasets of multiple top predator fishes from the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and developed new statistical methods that can be used to obtain a comprehensive ocean-scale understanding of food webs and climate impacts on marine top predators. We loosely define top predators not as species at the apex of the food web, but rather a guild of large predators near the top of the food web. Specifically, we present a framework for world-wide compilation and analysis of global stomach-contents and stable-isotope data of tunas and other large pelagic predatory fishes. To illustrate the utility of the statistical methods, we show an example using yellowfin tuna in a "test" area in the Pacific Ocean. Stomach-contents data were analyzed using a modified (bagged) classification tree approach, which is being prepared as an R statistical software package. Bulk delta N-15 values of yellowfin tuna muscle tissue were examined using a Generalized Additive Model, after adjusting for spatial differences in the delta N-15 values of the baseline primary producers predicted by a global coupled ocean circulation-biogeochemical-isotope model. Both techniques in tandem demonstrated the capacity of this approach to elucidate spatial patterns of variations in both forage species and predator trophic positions and have the potential to predict responses to climate change. We believe this methodology could be extended to all marine top predators. Our results emphasize the necessity for quantitative investigations of global-scale datasets when evaluating changes to the food webs underpinning top ocean predators under long-term climatic variability.

Crossing Latitudes-Long-Distance Tracking of an Apex Predator	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SHARKS CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; GULF-OF-MEXICO; MARINE PROTECTED AREA; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; TIGER SHARK; WHITE SHARKS; AUSTRALIAN WATERS; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; MESHING PROGRAM	Tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) are apex predators occurring in most tropical and warm temperate marine ecosystems, but we know relatively little of their patterns of residency and movement over large spatial and temporal scales. We deployed satellite tags on eleven tiger sharks off the north-western coast of Western Australia and used the Brownian Bridge kernel method to calculate home ranges and analyse movement behaviour. One individual recorded one of the largest geographical ranges of movement ever reported for the species, travelling over 4000 km during 517 days of monitoring. Tags on the remainder of the sharks reported for shorter periods (7-191 days). Most of these sharks had restricted movements and long-term (30-188 days) residency in coastal waters in the vicinity of the area where they were tagged. Core home range areas of sharks varied greatly from 1166.9 to 634,944 km(2). Tiger sharks spent most of their time in water temperatures between 23 degrees-26 degrees C but experienced temperatures ranging from 6 degrees C to 33 degrees C. One shark displayed seasonal movements among three distinct home range cores spread along most of the coast of Western Australia and generalized linear models showed that this individual had different patterns of temperature and depth occupancy in each region of the coast, with the highest probability of residency occurring in the shallowest areas of the coast with water temperatures above 23 degrees C. These results suggest that tiger sharks can migrate over very large distances and across latitudes ranging from tropical to the cool temperate waters. Such extensive long-term movements may be a key element influencing the connectivity of populations within and among ocean basins.	[Ferreira, Luciana C.; Vianna, Gabriel M.

Microarray applications to understand the impact of exposure to environmental contaminants in wild dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)	MARINE GENOMICS			English	Article						Transcriptome; Common bottlenose dolphin; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Ocean health	BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL CONGENERS; PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; GULF-OF-MEXICO; GENE-EXPRESSION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; THYROID-HORMONES; AROCLOR 1268; PCB; ATLANTIC	It is increasingly common to monitor the marine environment and establish geographic trends of environmental contamination by measuring contaminant levels in animals from higher trophic levels. The health of an ecosystem is largely reflected in the health of its inhabitants. As an apex predator, the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) can reflect the health of near shore marine ecosystems, and reflect coastal threats that pose risk to human health, such as legacy contaminants or marine toxins, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and brevetoxins. Major advances in the understanding of dolphin biology and the unique adaptations of these animals in response to the marine environment are being made as a result of the development of celllines for use in in vitro experiments, the production of monoclonal antibodies to recognize dolphin proteins, the development of dolphin DNA microarrays to measure global gene expression and the sequencing of the dolphin genome. These advances may play a central role in understanding the complex and specialized biology of the dolphin with regard to how this species responds to an array of environmental insults. This work presents the creation, characterization and application of a new molecular tool to better understand the complex and unique biology of the common bottlenose dolphin and its response to environmental stress and infection. A dolphin oligo microarray representing 24,418 unigene sequences was developed and used to analyze blood samples collected from 69 dolphins during capture-release health assessments at five geographic locations (Beaufort, NC, Sarasota Bay, FL, Saint Joseph Bay, FL Sapelo Island, GA and Brunswick, GA). The microarray was validated and tested for its ability to: I) distinguish male from female dolphins; 2) differentiate dolphins inhabiting different geographic locations (Atlantic coasts vs the Gulf of Mexico); and 3) study in detail dolphins resident in one site, the Georgia coast known to be heavily contaminated by Aroclor 1268, an uncommon polychlorinated (PCB) mixture. The microarray was able to distinguish dolphins by sex, geographic location, and corroborate previously published health irregularities for the Georgia dolphins. Genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, development/differentiation and oncogenic pathways were found to be differentially expressed in GA dolphins. The report bridges the advancements in dolphin genome sequencing to the first step towards providing a cost-effective means to screen for indicators of chemical toxin exposure as well as disease status in top level predators.

Preliminary Evidence for the Organisation of a Bacterial Community by Zooplanktivores at the Top of an Estuarine Planktonic Food Web	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bacteria; Unicellular eukaryotic algae; Apex predation; Trophic cascading; 16S rRNA; Pyrosequencing	TROPHIC CASCADES; FEEDING ECOLOGY; MARINE; DIVERSITY; SIZE; ECOSYSTEMS; PREDATION; DYNAMICS; OCEAN; FISH	As part of a larger investigation, the effect of apex predation on estuarine bacterial community structure, through trophic cascading, was investigated using experimental in situ mesocosms. Through either the removal (filtration) or addition of specific size classes of planktonic groups, four different trophic scenarios were established using estuarine water and its associated plankton. One such treatment represented a "natural" scenario in which stable apex predatory pressure was qualified. Water samples were collected over time from each of the treatments for bacterial community evaluation. These samples were assessed through pyrosequencing of the variable regions 4 and 5 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and analysed at the species operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level using a community procedure. The blue-green group dominated the samples, followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Samples were the most similar among treatments at the commencement of the experiment. While the bacterial communities sampled within each treatment changed over time, the deviation from initial appeared to be linked to the treatment trophic scenarios. The least temporal deviation-from-initial in bacterial community was found within the stable apex predatory pressure treatment. These findings are consistent with trophic cascade theory, whereby predators mediate interactions at multiple lower trophic levels with consequent repercussions for diversity.	[Wasserman, R.

Effects of sea temperature and stratification changes on seabird breeding success	CLIMATE RESEARCH			English	Article						Black-legged kittiwake; Oceanography; Potential energy anomaly; Productivity; Rissa tridactyla; SST; Tracking data	BLACK-LEGGED KITTIWAKES; SANDEEL AMMODYTES-MARINUS; EUROPEAN CONTINENTAL-SHELF; SCOTTISH NORTH-SEA; RISSA-TRIDACTYLA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HARBOR PORPOISES; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; LESSER SANDEEL; ABUNDANCE	As apex predators in marine ecosystems, seabirds may primarily experience climate change impacts indirectly, via changes to their food webs. Observed seabird population declines have been linked to climate-driven oceanographic and food web changes. However, relationships have often been derived from relatively few colonies and consider only sea surface temperature (SST), so important drivers, and spatial variation in drivers, could remain undetected. Further, explicit climate change projections have rarely been made, so longer-term risks remain unclear. Here, we use tracking data to estimate foraging areas for 11 black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridacty la colonies in the UK and Ireland, thus reducing reliance on single colonies and allowing calculation of colony-specific oceanographic conditions. We use mixed models to consider how SST, the potential energy anomaly (indicating density stratification strength) and the timing of seasonal stratification influence kittiwake productivity. Across all colonies, higher breeding success was associated with weaker stratification before breeding and lower SSTs during the breeding season. Eight colonies with sufficient data were modelled individually: higher productivity was associated with later stratification at 3 colonies, weaker stratification at 2, and lower SSTs at one, whilst 2 colonies showed no significant relationships. Hence, key drivers of productivity varied among colonies. Climate change projections, made using fitted models, indicated that breeding success could decline by 21 to 43% between 1961-90 and 2070-99. Climate change therefore poses a longer-term threat to kittiwakes, but as this will be mediated via availability of key prey species, other marine apex predators could also face similar threats.

Pattern of movements within a home reef in the Chesterfield Islands (Coral Sea) by the endangered Giant Grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES			English	Article						Coral reefs apex predator; serranidae; site fidelity; acoustic telemetry; spawning aggregations	FISHES; AGGREGATIONS; PACIFIC; ITAJARA; MEXICO; GULF	This study determined the movements of a Giant Grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus, in which an acoustic tag was surgically implanted and monitored by an array of six VR2W acoustic receiver units from August 2010 to January 2013 in the remote, uninhabited Chesterfield Islands, Coral Sea (800 km West of New Caledonia). Our data revealed a home reef area (residency rate of 44.9%) with an increased activity revealed by movements at dawn and dusk toward and between two adjacent reef passages, probably for foraging. The fish was absent from its resident reef between October and December 2010 and 2012, corresponding to the time known for spawning aggregations of this species in New Caledonia. A skipped spawning seems to have occurred in 2011. We hope these data will be complemented in the future by locating the spawning site or sites and thus provide adequate conservation measures. The Coral Sea links two World Heritage Sites, the Australian Great Barrier Reefs and the New Caledonian coral reefs. It would be fitting to create a Marine Protected Area for the Chesterfield Islands between these two major conservation areas of the sea.

Population status and threats to Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) in South and Western Australia	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE			English	Review						apex marine predator; cumulative mortality; Flesh-footed Shearwater; indicator species; Puffinus carneipes	TAILED SHEARWATERS; PLASTIC INGESTION; LONGLINE FISHERY; SEABIRD BYCATCH; CONSERVATION; ISLAND; COLONY; ALBATROSSES; MANAGEMENT; PACIFICUS	Seabirds are considered reliable indicators of the marine environment due to their reliance on ocean-based resources and position at the top of the marine foodweb. The status of the world's bird populations have deteriorated over the past 20 years with seabirds declining faster than any other bird group. For some seabird species, a lack of data or synthesis of available data limits our ability to detect changes in population trends and gain insight into the condition of the surrounding marine environment. The Flesh-footed Shearwater (FFSH; Puffinus carneipes) exemplifies this with demographic and count data either absent or outdated for most breeding islands. Results of a survey of 20 FFSH breeding islands in South and Western Australia during 2011-2014, and a synthesis of all available data indicate the current global population is substantially smaller than previously thought, comprising no more than 74 000 breeding pairs. While much of the reduction in numbers is due to outdated burrow counts which are shown to be a poor measure of population size in this species, there is evidence of a decline in numbers on at least six islands that account for similar to 40% of the world's population. A review of novel and existing data on FFSH breeding habits (burrow occupancy and density), concurrent threats, and population size in South and Western Australia are presented here along with priorities for management of this declining marine predator.

J	Randhawa, HS; Poulin, R; Krkosek, M				Randhawa, Haseeb S.; Poulin, Robert; Krkosek, Martin			Increasing rate of species discovery in sharks coincides with sharp population declines: implications for biodiversity	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							MARINE FOOD WEBS; GULF-OF-MEXICO; BODY-SIZE; FISH COMMUNITIES; BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; GLOBAL EXTINCTION; PREDATORY SHARKS; NORTH-AMERICAN	The global biodiversity of some taxonomic groups is poorly described, but thought to be decreasing rapidly. Surprisingly, this holds for a group of the world's most iconic large-bodied animals: sharks. Our analysis shows rapid and steep contemporary population declines in sharks coinciding with an increasing rate in species discovery. Larger sharks occupying lower trophic positions with wide geographic distributions (latitudinal ranges) found in shallow waters tend to be discovered first. In light of this increasing trend in species discovery and a cumulative description record far from reaching an asymptote, models cannot predict the global number of sharks. Our results highlight that while our knowledge of shark diversity improves at an accelerating rate, this diversity is under threat and declining rapidly; most shark species are vulnerable to declines, especially smaller-bodied sharks. This surprising finding may relate to mesopredator declines following periods of rapid expansion due to the demise of large sharks (apex predators). Furthermore, shark population declines are structured by phylogeny and, to a lesser extent, geography. Decline in sharks are likely to influence other species as well, e.g. via trophic cascades. The net result may be a greater loss of biodiversity in the oceans and could potentially explain why fewer extinction events are observed than predicted by models. Likewise, it is not inconceivable that species may be lost prior to their discovery.

AGE AND GROWTH OF THE GIANT SEA BASS, STEREOLEPIS GIGAS	CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS			English	Article							SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA-BIGHT; FISH POPULATIONS; MARINE; RECOVERY; COLLAPSE	The giant sea bass, Stereolepis gigas, is the largest bony fish that inhabits California shallow rocky reef communities and is listed by IUCN as a critically endangered species, yet little is known about its life history. To address questions of growth and longevity, 64 samples were obtained through collaborative efforts with commercial fish markets and scientific gillnetting. Sagittae (otoliths) were cross-sectioned and analyzed with digital microscopy. Age estimates indicate that S. gigas is a long-lived species attaining at least 76 years of age. Over 90% of the variation between age (years) and standard length (mm) was accounted for in the von Bertalanffy growth model (R-2 = 0.911). The calculated von Bertalanffy growth function parameters (K = 0.044, t(0) = -0.339, L-infinity = 2026.2 mm SL) for S. gigas were characteristic of a large, slow-growing, apex predator.

Sharks modulate their escape behavior in response to predator size, speed and approach orientation	ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Sharks; Predator-prey interaction; Escape response; Vision; Lateral line	SOUTHERN AFRICA; HERRING LARVAE; MAUTHNER CELL; WATER-FLOW; FISH; PERFORMANCE; VARIABILITY; AVOIDANCE; GOLDFISH; EVASION	Escape responses are often critical for surviving predator prey interactions. Nevertheless, little is known about how predator size, speed and approach orientation impact escape performance, especially in larger prey that are primarily viewed as predators. We used realistic shark models to examine how altering predatory behavior and morphology (size, speed and approach orientation) influences escape behavior and performance in Squalus acanthias, a shark that is preyed upon by apex marine predators. Predator models induced C-start escape responses, and increasing the size and speed of the models triggered a more intense response (increased escape turning rate and acceleration). In addition, increased predator size resulted in greater responsiveness from the sharks. Among the responses, predator approach orientation had the most significant impact on escapes, such that the head-on approach, as compared to the tail-on approach, induced greater reaction distances and increased escape turning rate, speed and acceleration. Thus, the anterior binocular vision in sharks renders them less effective at detecting predators approaching from behind. However, it appears that sharks compensate by performing high-intensity escapes, likely induced by the lateral line system, or by a sudden visual flash of the predator entering their field of view. Our study reveals key aspects of escape behavior in sharks, highlighting the modulation of performance in response to predator approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Mammalian mesopredators on islands directly impact both terrestrial and marine communities	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Predator-prey interactions; Marine food webs; Mesopredator release; Nest predation; Trophic cascades	MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; ANNUAL REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NEST PREDATION; FOOD WEBS; CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS; INTERTIDAL COMMUNITIES; FOREST FRAGMENTS; INTRODUCED RATS; SONG SPARROWS; CLUTCH SIZE	Medium-sized mammalian predators (i.e. mesopredators) on islands are known to have devastating effects on the abundance and diversity of terrestrial vertebrates. Mesopredators are often highly omnivorous, and on islands, may have access not only to terrestrial prey, but to marine prey as well, though impacts of mammalian mesopredators on marine communities have rarely been considered. Large apex predators are likely to be extirpated or absent on islands, implying a lack of top-down control of mesopredators that, in combination with high food availability from terrestrial and marine sources, likely exacerbates their impacts on island prey. We exploited a natural experiment-the presence or absence of raccoons (Procyon lotor) on islands in the Gulf Islands, British Columbia, Canada-to investigate the impacts that this key mesopredator has on both terrestrial and marine prey in an island system from which all native apex predators have been extirpated. Long-term monitoring of song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) nests showed raccoons to be the predominant nest predator in the Gulf Islands. To identify their community-level impacts, we surveyed the distribution of raccoons across 44 Gulf Islands, and then compared terrestrial and marine prey abundances on six raccoon-present and six raccoon-absent islands. Our results demonstrate significant negative effects of raccoons on terrestrial, intertidal, and shallow subtidal prey abundance, and point to additional community-level effects through indirect interactions. Our findings show that mammalian mesopredators not only affect terrestrial prey, but that, on islands, their direct impacts extend to the surrounding marine community.

However, it is not clear whether oceanic ecosystem recovery from the PTME was globally synchronous because of the apparent lack of such predators in the eastern Tethyan/western Panthalassic region prior to the Late Triassic. Here we report a gigantic nothosaur from the lower Middle Triassic of Luoping in southwest China (eastern Tethyan ocean), which possesses the largest known lower jaw among Triassic sauropterygians. Phylogenetic analysis suggests parallel evolution of gigantism in Triassic sauropterygians. Discovery of this gigantic apex predator, together with associated diverse marine reptiles and the complex food web, indicates global recovery of shallow marine ecosystems from PTME by the early Middle Triassic.

The relationship between land use and emerging and legacy contaminants in an Apex predator, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), from two adjacent estuarine watersheds	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Persistent organohalogen compounds (POC); Bottlenose dolphins; Bioaccumulation; Apex predator; Spatial distribution; Watershed; Land use	POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; HISTORICAL EMISSION INVENTORY; BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS; PORPOISE PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; MARINE MAMMALS; PCB CONGENERS; ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS; STENELLA-COERULEOALBA; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION	Background: Persistent organohalogen contaminant (POC) exposure is of concern in marine mammals due to the potential for adverse health effects. Studies have examined POCs in marine mammals on a regional scale; however, limited data exists on POC concentrations relative to land use and watersheds. Objective: Examine geographical variation of POC concentrations in bottlenose dolphins as it relates to land, and watershed, use. Methods: POC (PCBs, DDTs, and PBDEs) concentrations were measured in blubber of bottlenose dolphins (n = 40) sampled in estuarine waters near Charleston, SC. Photo-identification sighting histories were used to assess the dolphins' use of estuarine waters in two adjacent watersheds (Cooper Subbasin and Stono Subbasin) in the study area and to determine land use (developed, forested, agriculture, and wetland) associations. Results: Dolphins with >= 75% of their sightings in the Cooper Subbasin, which is characterized by a higher degree of developed land use, exhibited higher levels of PCBs, PBDEs, and total pesticides than those with >= 75% of their sightings in the Stono Subbasin. Observed differences were significant for Sigma PBDEs and Sigma DDTs/Sigma PCBs ratio. Significant positive correlations were observed between Sigma PBDEs and developed land use and between Sigma DDTs/Sigma PCBs and wetland land use. A significant negative correlation was observed between Sigma DDTs/Sigma PCBs and developed land use. Conclusion: The spatial pattern of PBDEs and the Sigma DDTs/Sigma PCBs detected in dolphin blubber was shown to vary significantly with adjacent watersheds and land use associations.

Three albatross species frequent the Bering Sea, the Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis), the black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes), and the endangered short-tailed albatross (Phoebastria albatrus). To determine if albatrosses changed their distribution or abundance in the eastern Bering Sea between 1975 and 2010, we examined at-sea survey data using the North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database. Within our study area, all three species of albatross occurred most frequently in the waters of the Aleutian Islands. In the eastern Bering Sea, all three species were most abundant near the shelf break, and in particular in the vicinity of the major submarine canyons in the shelf slope. Starting in the 1990s, population densities increased for all three albatross species, with a marked increase in the 2000s. In the 2000s, there was also an increase in the frequency at which albatrosses were recorded in the central and northern Bering Sea. Both black-footed and short-tailed albatrosses shifted the centers of their Bering Sea distributions northward. The Laysan albatross center of distribution shifted southward due to increased numbers along the southern shelf break, but densities also increased northward. We suggest that the observed changes in distribution and abundance of the three albatross species in the eastern Bering Sea may have been responses to an increase in the availability of squid, their primary prey, there. Additionally, the expansion of the distribution of the short-tailed albatross in the eastern Bering Sea may represent the reclamation of its previous range, now that the population is beginning to recover from near extinction caused by over harvesting. We suggest that predicted increases in ocean temperatures and northward movement of prey could result in albatrosses and other marine apex predators foraging farther north along the Bering Sea shelf and staying later in fall.

We investigated the population genetics of blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus; one of the most abundant reef-associated sharks and the apex predator of many shallow water reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Our sampling includes 4 widely separated locations in the Indo-Pacific and 11 islands in French Polynesia with different levels of coastal development. Four-teen microsatellite loci were analysed for samples from all locations and two mitochondrial DNA fragments, the control region and cytochrome b, were examined for 10 locations. For microsatellites, genetic diversity is higher for the locations in the large open systems of the Red Sea and Australia than for the fragmented habitat of the smaller islands of French Polynesia. Strong significant structure was found for distant locations with F-ST values as high as similar to 0.3, and a smaller but still significant structure is found within French Polynesia. Both mitochondrial genes show only a few mutations across the sequences with a dominant shared haplotype in French Polynesia and New Caledonia suggesting a common lineage different to that of East Australia. Demographic history analyses indicate population expansions in the Red Sea and Australia that may coincide with sea level changes after climatic events. Expansions and flat signals are indicated for French Polynesia as well as a significant recent bottleneck for Moorea, the most human-impacted lagoon of the locations in French Polynesia.

Tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) movement patterns and habitat use determined by satellite tagging in eastern Australian waters	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							NEW-SOUTH-WALES; PARTIAL MIGRATION; NORTH-ATLANTIC; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS; IMPROVING LIGHT; MARINE PREDATOR; MESHING PROGRAM; PRIONACE-GLAUCA; SITE FIDELITY	Partial migration is considered ubiquitous among vertebrates, but little is known about the movements of oceanodromous apex predators such as sharks, particularly at their range extents. PAT-Mk10 and SPOT5 electronic tags were used to investigate tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) spatial dynamics, site fidelity and habitat use off eastern Australia between April 2007 and May 2013. Of the 18 tags deployed, 15 recorded information on depth and/or temperature, and horizontal movements. Tracking times ranged between four and 408 days, with two recovered pop-up archival tags allowing 63 days of high-resolution archived data to be analysed. Overall mean proportions of time-at-depth revealed that G. cuvier spent the majority of time-at-depths of < 20 m, but undertook dives as deep as 920 m. Tagged sharks occupied ambient water temperatures from 29.5 A degrees C at the surface to 5.9 A degrees C at depth. Deep dives (> 500 m) occurred mostly around dawn and dusk, but no definitive daily dive patterns were observed. Horizontal movements were characterised by combinations of resident and transient behaviour that coincided with seasonal changes in water temperature. While the majority of movement activity was focused around continental slope waters, large-scale migration was evident with one individual moving from offshore Sydney, Australia, to New Caledonia (c. 1,800 km) in 48 days. Periods of tiger shark residency outside of Australia's fisheries management zones highlight the potential vulnerability of the species to unregulated fisheries and the importance of cross-jurisdictional arrangements for species' management and conservation.

Shark nets are devices used to minimize the interaction between beachgoers and potentially dangerous sharks; however, these nets have negatively impacted local and migratory shark populations, in addition to killing substantial quantities of other marine organisms. To address this issue, the present study developed and examined the effects of an alternative technology (the "Sharksafe" barrier) composed of two stimuli: (1) visual-artificial-kelp and (2) electrosensory-magnets, on C carcharias behavior. Generalized linear mixed effect models were used to test hypotheses pertaining to the effects of treatment type, exposure quantity (i.e. habituation), conspecific density, and water visibility on shark behavior. Analyses based on forty-nine, one-hour trials illustrate that the swim patterns of all sixty-three individual C carcharias was altered in the presence of the artificial kelp-the procedural control region, and the magnetic kelp-the magnetic region of the barrier (i.e. procedural control and magnetic regions reduced entrance frequency and increased avoidance and pass around frequency). Also, preliminary observations illustrated that the barrier had no observable impact on Cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) behavior. The C. carcharias-specific repellency associated with the Sharksafe barrier and the ability of the barrier to withstand harsh environmental conditions warrant future experiments to assess its exclusion capabilities on predatory sharks and possible application to replace shark nets.

A New Analysis of the Fossil Record	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SIGHTING RECORD; SHARKS; MYSTICETI; ACCURACY; CETACEA; RANGES; WHALE; RAYS	Carcharocles megalodon ("Megalodon") is the largest shark that ever lived. Based on its distribution, dental morphology, and associated fauna, it has been suggested that this species was a cosmopolitan apex predator that fed on marine mammals from the middle Miocene to the Pliocene (15.9-2.6 Ma). Prevailing theory suggests that the extinction of apex predators affects ecosystem dynamics. Accordingly, knowing the time of extinction of C. megalodon is a fundamental step towards understanding the effects of such an event in ancient communities. However, the time of extinction of this important species has never been quantitatively assessed. Here, we synthesize the most recent records of C. megalodon from the literature and scientific collections and infer the date of its extinction by making a novel use of the Optimal Linear Estimation (OLE) model. Our results suggest that C. megalodon went extinct around 2.6 Ma. Furthermore, when contrasting our results with known ecological and macroevolutionary trends in marine mammals, it became evident that the modern composition and function of modern gigantic filter-feeding whales was established after the extinction of C. megalodon. Consequently, the study of the time of extinction of C. megalodon provides the basis to improve our understanding of the responses of marine species to the removal of apex predators, presenting a deep-time perspective for the conservation of modern ecosystems.

Methylmercury in dried shark fins and shark fin soup from American restaurants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant	2013	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND			Shark fin soup; Mercury; Public health; Food	MEDITERRANEAN-SEA; EXPOSURE; SEAFOOD; RESIDUES; MERCURY; METAL; RISK; FISH; BMAA	Consumption of meat from large predatory sharks exposes human consumers to high levels of toxic monomethylmercury (MMHg). There also have been claims that shark fins, and hence the Asian delicacy shark fin soup, contain harmful levels of neurotoxic chemicals in combination with MMHg, although concentrations of MMHg in shark fins are unknown. We measured MMHg in dried, unprocessed fins (n = 50) of 13 shark species that occur in the international trade of dried shark fins as well as 50 samples of shark fin soup prepared by restaurants from around the United States. Concentrations of MMHg in fins ranged from 9 to 1720 ng/g dry wt. MMHg in shark fin soup ranged from <0.01 to 34 ng/mL, with MMHg averaging 62 +/- 7% of total Hg. The highest concentrations of MMHg and total Hg were observed in both fins and soup from large, high trophic level sharks such as hammerheads (Sphyrna spp.). Consumption of a 240 mL bowl of shark fin soup containing the average concentration of MMHg (4.6 ng/mL) would result in a dose of 1.1 mu g MMHg, which is 16% of the US. EPA's reference dose (0.1 mu g MMHg per 1 kg per day in adults) of 7.4 mu g per day for a 74 kg person. If consumed, the soup containing the highest measured MMHg concentration would exceed the reference dose by 17%. While shark fin soup represents a potentially important source of MMHg to human consumers, other seafood products, particularly the flesh of apex marine predators, contain much higher MMHg concentrations and can result in substantially greater exposures of this contaminant for people.

Residency Patterns and Migration Dynamics of Adult Bull Sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) on the East Coast of Southern Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SITE FIDELITY; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; TERM MOVEMENTS; APEX PREDATOR; HABITAT USE; CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEM; BEHAVIOR; OCEAN; MANAGEMENT	Bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) are globally distributed top predators that play an important ecological role within coastal marine communities. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal scales of their habitat use and associated ecological role. In this study, we employed passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the residency patterns and migration dynamics of 18 adult bull sharks (195283 cm total length) tagged in southern Mozambique for a period of between 10 and 22 months. The majority of sharks (n = 16) exhibited temporally and spatially variable residency patterns interspersed with migration events. Ten individuals undertook coastal migrations that ranged between 433 and 709 km (mean = 533 km) with eight of these sharks returning to the study site. During migration, individuals exhibited rates of movement between 2 and 59 km.d(-1) (mean = 17.58 km.d(-1)) and were recorded travelling annual distances of between 450 and 3760 km (mean = 1163 km). Migration towards lower latitudes primarily took place in austral spring and winter and there was a significant negative correlation between residency and mean monthly sea temperature at the study site. This suggested that seasonal change is the primary driver behind migration events but further investigation is required to assess how foraging and reproductive activity may influence residency patterns and migration. Results from this study highlight the need for further understanding of bull shark migration dynamics and suggest that effective conservation strategies for this vulnerable species necessitate the incorporation of congruent trans-boundary policies over large spatial scales.

Habitat and body size effects on the isotopic niche space of invasive lionfish and endangered Nassau grouper	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						apex predator; Bahamas; coral reef fish; Epinephelus striatus; invasive species; ontogenetic competition; Pterois spp.; resource partitioning; stable isotope analysis; trophic overlap	INDO-PACIFIC LIONFISH; CORAL-REEF FISH; PTEROIS-VOLITANS; FOOD WEBS; EPINEPHELUS-STRIATUS; LITTORAL FISHES; PREY; COMMUNITIES; SHIFTS; RECRUITMENT	Species invasions are a significant threat to global biodiversity and ecosystem function, and yet our knowledge of consequences for native species remains poor. The problem is exacerbated in highly speciose ecosystems like coral reefs. The invasion of the wider Caribbean by predatory lionfish (Pterois spp.) is one of the most successful marine colonizations ever documented, and its impact is anticipated to be substantial on native species. However, despite the ecological and commercial importance of iconic Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), the impacts of the invasion on this IUCN Red-Listed species remain unexamined. Using data gathered from two critical habitats in the Bahamas, we investigate isotopic niche space overlap between lionfish, Nassau grouper and putative prey species. Despite their relatively small body size, we find that lionfish occupy the highest isotopic niche position on patch reefs, occupying much of the same space as the native apex predator. Contrary to expectation, lionfish trophic level (delta N-15) does not increase with body size, contrasting with confamilials in their native range. However, we find that tissue carbon (delta C-13) changes systematically with body size on deep forereef habitats, representing a length-specific shift in food resources, with smaller individuals partitioning resources from larger individuals in this habitat but not on shallow patch reefs. We conclude that, despite the difference in body size, lionfish are capable of directly competing for food resources with Nassau grouper, and that impacts on guilds such as planktivores and invertivores may vary systematically by habitat. Our study contributes to the growing body of research aimed at understanding how a species that is relatively rare in its native range achieved the most successful fish invasion ever documented.

Domination by Reptiles in a Terrestrial Food Web of the Bahamas Prior to Human Occupation	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY			English	Article							NITROGEN-ISOTOPE RATIOS; STABLE-CARBON-ISOTOPE; BONE-COLLAGEN; CALIBRATION CURVES; MARINE; PLANTS; DIET; EXTINCTION; COMPONENTS; CROCODILE	Human activities in the Bahamas and other oceanic islands have damaged terrestrial ecosystems irreparably through the extinction of indigenous species. Tortoise and crocodile bones from Abaco Island in the Bahamas sampled for C-14-dating revealed a small overlap between the last occurrence of these large reptiles and early human settlement in the Bahamas. Before their extermination approximately 1,000 years ago, the dominant herbivore and carnivore on Abaco Island were the endemic Albury's Tortoise (Chelonoidis alburyorum) and the formerly widespread Cuban Crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer). Stable isotope data from carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in bone collagen from Late Holocene fossils suggest that these large reptiles were part of a terrestrial rather than marine or estuarine food web. Our proposal that Cuban Crocodiles were once the apex terrestrial predator in the Bahamas is supported by comparisons with published delta C-13 values for modern marine/estuarine crocodylians as compared to those of nonmarine reptilian and mammalian carnivores. For reptiles to occupy terrestrial trophic roles distinguishes Bahamian Islands from nearby Greater Antillean Islands (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico) where endemic mammals represent the largest herbivores and carnivores in prehuman times. This distinction is even greater when compared with Late Quaternary mammals of prehuman vertebrate communities in neighboring North America.

As part of an ongoing assessment of the effects of PCBs on population health, we analyzed tri- to deca-PCBs in the liver of 56 harbor seals (6 adult males, 50 pups) and in 11 blubber samples (4 adult males, 7 pups) and examined tissue-specific accumulation patterns, biomagnification potential, and toxic implications of current PCB concentrations. Hepatic Sigma 30PCB concentrations (overall mean +/- standard deviation: 76,860 +/- 111,800 ng/g lipid weight, lw) were higher than blubber concentrations (48,180 +/- 69,420 ng/g lw). Regional trends were suggestive of fresh PCB inputs from the industrialized, densely populated southern coast of New England versus the rural north. The lack of temporal trends confirmed that tissue concentrations of PCBs have plateaued since the early 1990s. Tissue distribution of PCBs varied significantly by age and, surprisingly by gender among the pups. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that lighter PCBs are selectively transferred from mother to pup blubber in relation to lipid solubility (log K-ow), but heavier PCBs may be efficiently transferred during late lactation from mother to pup liver. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) for Sigma(6)PCBs from prey fish to adult male seals ranged from 90 to 547 in the liver and 88 to 532 in the blubber, and suggested that molecular structure and metabolic capacity were more important influences than log Kow on the retention of PCBs. Blubber concentrations of Sigma(30)PCBs in 87% of the pups were an order of magnitude higher than recent toxic reference values (TRVs) calculated for Sigma(154)PCBs in nursing harbor seals, suggesting that the pups are at risk for PCB-mediated toxicity at a vulnerable stage of development. Given the recurring pattern of epizootics in these seals, the health of the population is of concern. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

These findings have been questioned, on the grounds that diver-surveys overestimate shark abundance. We evaluated whether divers encounter sharks at higher rates when they first enter the water, and whether these effects vary among reefs that are subject to different levels of human interaction due to management zoning. We also examined the consistency of abundance estimates derived from multiple survey methods. For timed-swim, towed-diver, and baited-remote-underwater-video (BRUV) surveys, encounter rates were constant over time. For audible-stationary-count (ASC) surveys, encounter rates were elevated initially, then decreased rapidly, but the extent of upward bias did not differ between management zones. Timed-swim, BRUV, and ASC surveys produced comparable estimates of shark density, however, towed-diver-surveys produced significantly lower estimates of shark density. Our findings provide no evidence for biases in diver-surveys: encounter rates with sharks were not elevated when divers first entered the water; behavioural responses of sharks were consistent across management zones; and diver-surveys yielded abundance estimates comparable to other stationary methods. Previous studies using underwater counts have concluded that sharks are vulnerable to low levels of illegal fishing in no-take management zones, and that additional measures are needed to protect species, which, like sharks, have demographic characteristics that make them vulnerable to low levels of exploitation. Our results support the robustness of the abundance estimates on which those conclusions have been based. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molluscan marginalia: serration at the lip edge in gastropods	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES			English	Article							MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; VETIGASTROPODA; EVOLUTION; FAMILY; GENUS; FASCIOLARIIDAE; NEOGASTROPODA; BIOGEOGRAPHY	The shells of many marine gastropods have ventrally directed serrations (serial projections) at the edge of the adult outer lip. These poorly studied projections arise as extensions either of external spiral cords or of interspaces between cords. This paper describes taxonomic, phylogenetic, architectural and functional aspects of serrations. Cord-associated serrations occur in cerithiids, strombids, the personid Distorsio anus, ocenebrine muricids and some cancellariids. Interspace-associated serrations are phylogenetically much more widespread, and occur in at least 16 family-level groups. The nature of serration may be taxonomically informative in some fissurellids, littorinids, strombids and costellariids, among other groups. Serrated outer lips occur only in gastropods in which the apex points more backward than upward, but the presence of serrations is not a necessary byproduct of the formation of spiral sculptural elements. In hard-bottom gastropods that do not flee from predators, pointed serrations may resist shear when the shell is clamped firmly to the substratum. The functions of serration in other gastropods are less clear, but likely involve defence against predators with soft feeding structures in some cases.

Can variations in the spatial distribution at sea and isotopic niche width be associated with consistency in the isotopic niche of a pelagic seabird species?	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							SHEARWATER CALONECTRIS-DIOMEDEA; STABLE-ISOTOPES; INDIVIDUAL SPECIALIZATION; CORYS SHEARWATERS; WANDERING ALBATROSSES; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; FEEDING ECOLOGY; MARINE PREDATOR; NORTH-ATLANTIC; GPS TRACKING	This study tested for fluctuations on short-term consistency (within about 1 month) in the isotopic niche of a pelagic seabird species. Short-term consistency in the isotopic niche was assessed using a wide-ranging apex predator, the Cory's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea, along a 3-year study (2010-2012), during both the pre-laying and chick-rearing periods, with markedly inter- and intra-annual differences in the foraging spatial distribution at sea and isotopic niche width. We used individual movement data and stable isotope data, analysed using recent metrics based in a Bayesian framework, of 69 adults breeding on a small neritic island in the North Atlantic (39A degrees 24'N, 009A degrees 30'W). As expected, our results confirm that isotopic niche expansion could arise via increased variation in spatial distribution at sea among individuals. Results suggest fluctuations on short-term consistency in the isotopic niche of Cory's shearwaters related to their different foraging patterns among periods and, ultimately, to presumably temporal changes in the availability and predictability of food resources. Short-term consistency in the isotopic niche was higher and persistent during periods when the population showed an intermediate isotopic niche width and absent when isotopic niche was either smaller or larger during the study period. These results suggest that consistency in the isotopic niche is an important characteristic of this population during the breeding period that may fluctuate depending on resources availability and should be important to understand the dynamics of foraging ecology of pelagic seabirds in general.

Environmental neurotoxins beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and mercury in shark cartilage dietary supplements	FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine; Mercury; Shark cartilage; Dietary supplements; Cyanotoxin	PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; CYANOBACTERIAL NEUROTOXIN; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; PROTEIN INCORPORATION; AMINO-ACIDS; GUAM; BIOMAGNIFICATION; ALS; EXPOSURE; CADMIUM	Shark cartilage products are marketed as dietary supplements with claimed health benefits for animal and human use. Shark fin and cartilage products sold as extracts, dry powders and in capsules are marketed based on traditional Chinese medicine claims that it nourishes the blood, enhances appetite, and energizes multiple internal organs. Shark cartilage contains a mixture of chondroitin and glucosamine, a popular nutritional supplement ingested to improve cartilage function. Sharks are long-lived apex predators, that bioaccumulate environmental marine toxins and methylmercury from dietary exposures. We recently reported detection of the cyanobacterial toxin beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in the fins of seven different species of sharks from South Florida coastal waters. Since BMAA has been linked to degenerative brain diseases, the consumption of shark products may pose a human risk for BMAA exposures. In this report, we tested sixteen commercial shark cartilage supplements for BMAA by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-FD) with fluorescence detection and ultra performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Total mercury (Hg) levels were measured in the same shark cartilage products by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS). We report here that BMAA was detected in fifteen out of sixteen products with concentrations ranging from 86 to 265 mu g/g (dry weight). All of the shark fin products contained low concentrations of Hg. While Hg contamination is a known risk, the results of the present study demonstrate that shark cartilage products also may contain the neurotoxin BMAA. Although the neurotoxic potential of dietary exposure to BMAA is currently unknown, the results demonstrate that shark cartilage products may contain two environmental neurotoxins that have synergistic toxicities.

Locations such as the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, northern Marianas Islands, Line Islands, U.S. remote Pacific Islands, Cocos-Keeling Atoll and Chagos archipelago have much higher reef fish biomass than islands and reefs near people. Much of the high biomass of most remote reef fish communities lies in the largest species, such as sharks, bumphead parrots, giant trevally, and humphead wrasse. Some, such as sharks and giant trevally, are apex predators, but others such as bumphead parrots and humphead wrasse, are not. At many locations, decreases in large reef fish species have been attributed to fishing. Fishing is well known to remove the largest fish first, and a quantitative measure of vulnerability to fishing indicates that large reef fish species are much more vulnerable to fishing than small fish. The removal of large reef fish by fishing parallels the extinction of terrestrial megafauna by early humans. However large reef fish have great value for various ecological roles and for reef tourism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Winter and spring controls on the summer food web of the coastal West Antarctic Peninsula	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; SOUTHERN ANNULAR MODE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA-ICE; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; VARIABILITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; DISTRIBUTIONS; OCEAN; RECRUITMENT	Understanding the mechanisms by which climate variability affects multiple trophic levels in food webs is essential for determining ecosystem responses to climate change. Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4-6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Adelie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem.

Throughout this period they have benefitted from an immune system with the same fundamental components found in terrestrial vertebrates like man. Additionally, sharks have some rather extraordinary immune mechanisms which mammals lack. Areas covered: In this review the author briefly orients the reader to sharks, their adaptive immunity, and their important phylogenetic position in comparative immunology. The author also differentiates some of the myths from facts concerning these animals, their cartilage, and cancer. From thereon, the author explores some of the more remarkable capabilities and products of shark lymphocytes. Sharks have an isotype of light chain-less antibodies that are useful tools in molecular biology and are moving towards translational use in the clinic. These special antibodies are just one of the several tricks of shark lymphocyte antigen receptor systems. Expert opinion: While shark cartilage has not helped oncology patients, shark immunoglobulins and T cell receptors do offer exciting novel possibilities for immunotherapeutics. Much of the clinical immunology developmental pipeline has turned from traditional vaccines to passively delivered monoclonal antibody-based drugs for targeted depletion, activation, blocking and immunomodulation. The immunogenetic tools of shark lymphocytes, battle-tested since the dawn of our adaptive immune system, are well poised to expand the design landscape for the next generation of immunotherapy products.

These changes are integrated into the tissues of apex predators over space and time and can be quantified using stable isotopes in the inert feathers of historical and contemporary avian specimens. We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) from Western and South Australia from 1936-2011. The Flesh-footed Shearwaters more than doubled their trophic niche (from 3.91 +/- 1.37 parts per thousand(2) to 10.00 +/- 1.79 parts per thousand(2)), and dropped an entire trophic level in 75 years (predicted delta N-15 decreased from +16.9 parts per thousand to + 13.5 parts per thousand, and d 13 C from -16.9 parts per thousand to -17.9 parts per thousand) - the largest change in delta N-15 yet reported in any marine bird, suggesting a relatively rapid shift in the composition of the Indian Ocean food web, or changes in baseline delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. A stronger El Nino-Southern Oscillation results in a weaker Leeuwin Current in Western Australia, and decreased Flesh-footed Shearwater delta C-13 and delta N-15. Current climate forecasts predict this trend to continue, leading to increased oceanic 'tropicalization' and potentially competition between Flesh-footed Shearwaters and more tropical sympatric species with expanding ranges. Flesh-footed Shearwater populations are declining, and current conservation measures aimed primarily at bycatch mitigation are not restoring populations. Widespread shifts in foraging, as shown here, may explain some of the reported decline. An improved understanding and ability to mitigate the impacts of global climactic changes is therefore critical to the long-term sustainability of this declining species.

Not worth the risk: apex predators suppress herbivory on coral reefs	OIKOS			English	Article							MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; TROPHIC CASCADES; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; MARINE RESERVE; BASE-LINES; FOOD-WEB; ECOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; DENSITY	Apex predators are known to exert strong ecological effects, either through direct or indirect predator-prey interactions. Indirect interactions have the potential to influence ecological communities more than direct interactions as the effects are propagated throughout the population as opposed to only one individual. Indirect effects of apex predators are well documented in terrestrial environments, however there is a paucity of information for marine environments. Furthermore, manipulative studies, as opposed to correlative observations, isolating apex predator effects are lacking. Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems, providing a useful model system for investigating the ecological role of apex predators and their influence on lower trophic levels. Using predator models and transplanted macroalgae we examined the indirect effects of predators on herbivore foraging behaviour. We show that the presence of a model reef shark or large coral-grouper led to a substantial reduction in bite rate and species richness of herbivorous fishes and an almost absolute localized cessation of macroagal removal, due to the perceived risk of predation. A smaller-sized coral-grouper also reduced herbivore diversity and activity but to a lesser degree than the larger model predators. These indirect effects of apex predators on the foraging behaviour of herbivores may have flow-on effects on the biomass and distribution of macroalgae, and the functioning of coral reef ecosystems.

Nannofossil assemblages from the immediately overlying strata belong to the late but not latest Campanian calcareous nannofossil standard zone CC22, based on the presence of Uniplanarius trifidus and Eiffellithus eximius. The specimen includes a broken premaxilla, the anterior part of the maxillae and dentaries in articulation: preserved teeth show distinctive characters previously unreported in other mosasaurs. Although the marginal teeth show a posterior migration of the labial carina along the jaw length - diagnostic of derived mosasaurines - they are unusual in the combination of features, including anteriormost teeth with asteroid cross section followed by teeth with crowns twisted labioposteriorly from one-third to one-half of their height toward the apices. A comparison between the new specimen and Mosasaurus hoffmanni skulls suggests an estimated skull length comparable with some of the largest known mosasaurids. Consequently, the new specimen represents the largest mosasaur and the largest fossil reptile found in Italy to date. Several lines of dental evidence also support the interpretation of the Italian mosasaur as a macrophagous generalist predator. Paleogeographic reconstruction for the Argille Scagliose Complex as well as the occurrence of typical low- to mid-latitude nannofossils support a southern Tethyan margin affinity of the taxon.

Temporal Patterns in the Foraging Behavior of Sea Otters in Alaska	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						activity budget; Alaska; diving; Enhydra lutris; foraging behavior; multilevel model; population status; predator; sea otter; time-depth recorder	VALDEZ OIL-SPILL; TIME BUDGETS; POPULATION STATUS; MARINE PREDATOR; AMCHITKA ISLAND; ENHYDRA-LUTRIS; BALD EAGLES; PREY; FLEXIBILITY; CALIFORNIA	Activity time budgets in apex predators have been proposed as indicators of population status relative to resource limitation or carrying capacity. We used archival time-depth recorders implanted in 15 adult female and 4 male sea otters (Enhydra lutris) from the northernmost population of the species, Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA, to examine temporal patterns in their foraging behavior. Sea otters that we sampled spent less time foraging during summer (females 8.8 hr/day, males 7.9 hr/day) than other seasons (females 10.1-10.5 hr/day, males 9.2-9.5 hr/day). Both sexes showed strong preferences for diurnal foraging and adjusted their foraging effort in response to the amount of available daylight. One exception to this diurnal foraging mode occurred after females gave birth. For approximately 3 weeks post-partum, females switched to nocturnal foraging, possibly in an effort to reduce the risk of predation by eagles on newborn pups. We used multilevel mixed regression models to assess the contribution of several biological and environmental covariates to variation in the daily foraging effort of parous females. In the random effects only model, 87% of the total variation in foraging effort was within-otter variation. The relatively small among-otter variance component (13%) indicates substantial consistency in the foraging effort of sea otters in this northern population. In the top 3 models, 17% of the within-otter variation was explained by reproductive stage, day length, wind speed, air temperature and a wind speed x air temperature interaction. This study demonstrates the potential importance of environmental and reproductive effects when using activity budgets to assess population status relative to carrying capacity. Published 2014.

Results showed that catch and biomass of common squid was highest in this ecosystem (catch, 0.302 t/km(2); biomass, 1.031 t/km(2)). Although this ecosystem consists of primary producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and terminal consumers, most taxonomic groups were classified as secondary consumers. Common minke whales were classified as terminal consumers along with apex predators. Trophic level of common minke whales in this ecosystem was estimated at 3.34, and mean trophic level of this ecosystem was estimated as 2.91. Relative contribution of common squid to total energy flow at trophic level III, which includes common minke whales, was highest (72.0%). However, relative contribution of common minke whales at this trophic level was low (1.3%) compared with other taxonomic groups. This study is one of the first to address anthropogenic impacts (commercial whaling) on the trophic role of common minke whales in the East Sea, and it could potentially be used to understand the importance of common minke whales to this ecosystem within a context of potential biological removal (PBR).

In this study, trophic positions of sharks were estimated using stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen for five representative species caught by the Chinese longline fleet in the mid-east Pacific, i.e., the blue shark (Prionace glauca), the bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), the silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), and the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus). Of these species, oceanic whitetip shark has the lowest trophic level and mean delta N-15 value (3.9 and 14.93aEuro degrees +/- 0.84aEuro degrees), whereas bigeye thresher shark has the highest level/values (4.5 and 17.02aEuro degrees +/- 1.21aEuro degrees, respectively). The bigeye thresher shark has significantly higher delta N-15 value than other shark species, indicating its higher trophic position. The blue shark and oceanic whitetip shark has significantly higher delta C-13 values than bigeye thresher shark, silky shark and scalloped hammerhead, possibly due to different diets and/or living habitats. The stable isotope data and stomach content data are highly consistent, suggesting that stable isotope analysis supplements traditional feeding ecology study of sharks, and thus contributes to understanding their trophic linkage.

Large pelagic predators could jeopardize the recovery of endangered Atlantic salmon	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							TUNA THUNNUS-THYNNUS; SATELLITE ARCHIVAL TAGS; WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; SHARK LAMNA-NASUS; PORBEAGLE SHARK; CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; SCOTIAN SHELF; WHITE SHARK; SALAR; MOVEMENTS	Long-term population viability of Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is threatened by high levels of marine mortality during migration. Pop-up satellite archival tags on repeat spawners provide direct evidence of extensive natural mortality of migrating salmon in coastal zones attributed to predation by large pelagic fish and no evidence of fishing mortality. Ingested tags show that salmon with a coastal migration are eaten by porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) inside the Bay of Fundy, whereas distant migrants are consumed by Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and other apex predators along the Scotian Shelf. Mortality is clustered in a few zones because of similar predator-prey habitat preferences and overlapping migration paths. The extent of predation in salmon populations with different migration strategies can account for observed decline rates in neighbouring populations with different life histories. The impact on endangered salmon populations that rely on multiple repeat spawners for population stability may be sufficient to hamper ongoing recovery efforts.

We review (1) the distribution of shark species among the primary habitats of the GBRMP (coral reefs, inshore/shelf, pelagic and deep-water habitats) (2) the relative exploitation of each species by fisheries, and (3) how current catch rates interact with their vulnerability and trophic index. Excluding rays and chimaeras, we identify a total of 82 shark species in the GBRMP. We find that shark research in the GBRMP has yielded little quantitative information on most species. Reef sharks are largely site-fidelic, but can move large distances and some regularly use non-reef habitats. Inshore and shelf sharks use coastal habitats either exclusively or during specific times in their life cycle (e.g. as nurseries). Virtually nothing is known about the distribution and habitat use of the GBRMP's pelagic and deep-water sharks. At least 46 species (53.5 %) are caught in one or more fisheries, but stock assessments are lacking for most. At least 17 of the sharks caught are considered highly vulnerable to exploitation. We argue that users of shark resources should be responsible for demonstrating that a fishery is sustainable before exploitation is allowed to commence or continue. This fundamental change in management principle will safeguard against stock collapses that have characterised many shark fisheries.	[Frisch, Ashley J.; Graham, Nicholas A.

Nitrogen stable isotopes (N-15) provide a powerful tool to estimate TP but are limited by a pragmatic assumption that isotope discrimination is constant (change in N-15 between predator and prey, N-15=3.4 parts per thousand), resulting in an additive framework that omits known N-15 variation. Through meta-analysis, we determine narrowing discrimination from an empirical linear relationship between experimental N-15 and N-15 values of prey consumed. The resulting scaled N-15 framework estimated reliable TPs of zooplanktivores to tertiary piscivores congruent with known feeding relationships that radically alters the conventional structure of marine food webs. Apex predator TP estimates were markedly higher than currently assumed by whole-ecosystem models, indicating perceived food webs have been truncated and species-interactions over simplified. The scaled N-15 framework will greatly improve the accuracy of trophic estimates widely used in ecosystem-based management.

Growth and Maximum Size of Tiger Sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in Hawaii	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; GULF-OF-MEXICO; INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; SOUTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA; CARCHARHINUS-OBSCURUS; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; MARINE PREDATOR; DUSKY SHARKS; CATCH RATES	Tiger sharks (Galecerdo cuvier) are apex predators characterized by their broad diet, large size and rapid growth. Tiger shark maximum size is typically between 380 & 450 cm Total Length (TL), with a few individuals reaching 550 cm TL, but the maximum size of tiger sharks in Hawaii waters remains uncertain. A previous study suggested tiger sharks grow rather slowly in Hawaii compared to other regions, but this may have been an artifact of the method used to estimate growth (unvalidated vertebral ring counts) compounded by small sample size and narrow size range. Since 1993, the University of Hawaii has conducted a research program aimed at elucidating tiger shark biology, and to date 420 tiger sharks have been tagged and 50 recaptured. All recaptures were from Hawaii except a single shark recaptured off Isla Jacques Cousteau (24 degrees 13'17 '' N 109 degrees 52'14 '' W), in the southern Gulf of California (minimum distance between tag and recapture sites = approximately 5,000 km), after 366 days at liberty (DAL). We used these empirical mark-recapture data to estimate growth rates and maximum size for tiger sharks in Hawaii. We found that tiger sharks in Hawaii grow twice as fast as previously thought, on average reaching 340 cm TL by age 5, and attaining a maximum size of 403 cm TL. Our model indicates the fastest growing individuals attain 400 cm TL by age 5, and the largest reach a maximum size of 444 cm TL. The largest shark captured during our study was 464 cm TL but individuals >450 cm TL were extremely rare (0.005% of sharks captured). We conclude that tiger shark growth rates and maximum sizes in Hawaii are generally consistent with those in other regions, and hypothesize that a broad diet may help them to achieve this rapid growth by maximizing prey consumption rates.

Here we compare movement, reef-fidelity, and ocean migration for tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, across the Coral Sea, with an emphasis on New Caledonia. Thirty-three tiger sharks (1.54 to 3.9 m total length) were tagged with passive acoustic transmitters and their localised movements monitored on receiver arrays in New Caledonia, the Chesterfield and Lord Howe Islands in the Coral Sea, and the east coast of Queensland, Australia. Satellite tags were also used to determine habitat use and movements among habitats across the Coral Sea. Sub-adults and one male adult tiger shark displayed year-round residency in the Chesterfields with two females tagged in the Chesterfields and detected on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, after 591 and 842 days respectively. In coastal barrier reefs, tiger sharks were transient at acoustic arrays and each individual demonstrated a unique pattern of occurrence. From 2009 to 2013, fourteen sharks with satellite and acoustic tags undertook wide-ranging movements up to 1114 km across the Coral Sea with eight detected back on acoustic arrays up to 405 days after being tagged. Tiger sharks dove 1136 m and utilised three-dimensional activity spaces averaged at 2360 km(3). The Chesterfield Islands appear to be important habitat for sub-adults and adult male tiger sharks. Management strategies need to consider the wide-ranging movements of large (sub-adult and adult) male and female tiger sharks at the individual level, whereas fidelity to specific coastal reefs may be consistent across groups of individuals. Coastal barrier reef MPAs, however, only afford brief protection for large tiger sharks, therefore determining the importance of other oceanic Coral Sea reefs should be a priority for future research.

Due to their amphibious life cycle, pinnipeds are one of the most vulnerable groups to habitat loss and degradation. Reducing knowledge gaps that still exist regarding temporal changes in tropical pinniped habitat use is therefore of particular importance for conservation efforts. We analyzed terrestrial habitat use phenology of a tropical otariid, the Galapagos sea lion Zalophus wollebaeki. Regular land-based censuses were carried out in Wreck Bay of San Cristobal Island, Galapagos, between 2008 and 2012 to explore seasonal changes in sea lion abundance, distribution, and preferences among different habitat types. A daily cycle of haul-out patterns was observed. Animals aggregated on sandy beaches during the coldest periods of the day and were more abundant on rocky and artificial structures when air temperature was warmer. The use of artificial floating platforms as resting places by Z. wollebaeki was described for the first time and linked to environmental variability, suggesting that this may be a successful management tool for pinnipeds inhabiting low latitudes. Further, this species demonstrated seasonal distribution changes, aggregating in high densities during warm seasons and maintaining more even distributions during cold seasons. Sea surface temperature, air temperature, and the onset of the breeding season were the variables that most significantly influenced haul-out patterns of Z. wollebaeki, indicating that this species can adapt to changing environmental conditions by displaying a high degree of plasticity regarding its distribution and terrestrial microhabitat preferences.

Eco-standards such as shopping guides, ecolabels, and stewardship certifications are now commonplace. However, in many cultures dietary guidelines have existed for thousands of years, and anthropologists have argued that such dietary rules emerged to reduce environmental impacts by encouraging exploitation of productive species, increasing ecological efficiency, or decreasing harvest of apex predators. We explored some of the environmental consequences for marine and aquatic systems of one of the more familiar ancient dietary traditions, keeping kosher. We sampled nearly 4500 seafood items from 68 supermarkets and 112 restaurants. For each species, we determined whether the item was kosher or not and then estimated trophic level, food miles, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions. Our results revealed that food miles, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions associated with transportation were all less for kosher than nonkosher seafood. In general, these differences could be mitigated by consuming only Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch "best" choices. On the other hand, although food miles, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions associated with kosher seafood appears to be lower than nonkosher seafood, the potential trophic impact of kosher seafood appears to be greater than nonkosher selections. Our results highlight that even though the moral underpinnings of conservation and religion can be very different, careful scientific attention to the environmental costs and benefits of traditional foodways offers an important entry point for engagement with cultural practices and belief systems.

We compared home range estimates and swimming pattern analyses to those established at Mossel Bay, another white shark aggregation area roughly 300 km to the east. Traditional home range estimates used in Mossel Bay did not account for movement or barriers, and were thus biased towards areas with very little shark movement (i.e. potential resting areas). We found that adapting a Movement-based Kernel Density Estimate (MKDE) could account for movement and barriers, resolving these issues. At Dyer Island and Geyser Rock, daytime shark habitat use was adjacent to the seal colony, with low rates of movement, non-linear swimming patterns and small activity areas. At night, rates of movement and linearity increased as sharks travelled further from the islands into deeper waters. MKDEs revealed 4 focal areas of habitat use: a channel between the 2 islands, an area to the south of the seal colony, another area near a kelp feature to the southwest of the seal colony and a reef system to the northwest. These results differed significantly from the habitat use at Mossel Bay, where focal areas occurred adjacent to the seal colony during the hours of dawn and dusk. We discuss possible explanations for these differences. This study is the first to make use of MKDEs in a complex marine landscape and highlights important differences in habitat use of a threatened species between 2 separate aggregation areas.

Using short-term measures of behaviour to estimate long-term fitness of southern elephant seals	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Kalman filter; Mirounga leonina; Population consequences of disturbance; State-space model; Telemetry data	MIROUNGA-LEONINA; WEANING MASS; EL-NINO; POPULATIONS; ISLAND; CONSEQUENCES; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; TRACKING; SURVIVAL	Environmental changes (a type of disturbance) are altering the habitat of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina, an apex marine predator in the Southern Ocean. As a result, individuals may shift their behaviour, spending more time in transit and less time foraging. The effects of these sublethal changes in behaviour can accumulate, indirectly impacting lifetime fitness through changes in individual survival and reproduction. If a sufficient proportion of the population is affected, the probability of population persistence will be altered. We used data from long-term telemetry studies of female elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia, to model the effect of behaviour on the seals' health (i.e. all internal factors that affect homeostasis). Through simulation, we investigated the effect of increasing periods of behavioural shifts, quantifying how the exclusion of maternal southern elephant seals from foraging habitat may affect their health, offspring survival, individual fitness and population growth rate. A long period of altered behaviour (>50% of an average foraging trip at sea) in 1 yr resulted in a small (0.4%) decline in population size the following year. However, a persistent disruption (e.g. 30 yr), caused for example by the long-term effects of climate change, could result in a 0.3% decline in individual fitness and a 10% decline in population size. Our approach to estimating the long-term population effects of short-term changes in individual behaviour can be generalised to include physiological effects and other causes of behavioural and physiological disruption, such as anthropogenic disturbance, for any species.

The broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus is one of the most important apex predators in temperate coastal areas around the world, yet little is known of its seasonal large-scale movements. Five male and five female sevengill sharks were equipped with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) in a coastal embayment in southern Tasmania, that collected depth and temperature data during winter, when the animals leave the coastal embayment, resulting in a dataset covering a total of 818 d. Animal tracks indicated that males moved northwards into warmer waters, whereas females remained in southern waters. Three of the females stayed in the Tasmanian coastal areas while the other two left, with one of them moving into deeper waters of up to 360 m depth at the southern edge of the Tasmanian shelf before returning to the Tasmanian coast. These sex-specific differences in large-scale movement could potentially lead to the differential exploitation of the sexes when the sharks leave the protected areas where they were tagged. Both males and females switched between diel vertical migration and reverse diel vertical migration over the course of their tracks and displayed oscillatory vertical movements, probably linked to foraging. These vertical movements persisted throughout the tracks, suggesting that sevengill sharks foraged continuously during their migration rather than switching between transiting and foraging modes.

Elasmobranch fishes, one of the earth's most ubiquitous and diverse clade of predatory species, provide a model group for defining marine predator roles. We consider whether the ecological predatory role of sharks is adequately defined by terrestrial-derived notions of apex-and mesopredation. Indeterminate growth and ontogenetic diet shifts may mean species-level classification of predatory roles is inadequate. We propose that examining the trophic level and body size of species might be the most pragmatic and informative way to define the ecological roles of predators.

Combining bio-logging and fatty acid signature analysis indicates spatio-temporal variation in the diet of the southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Annual variation; Blubber; Fatty acids; Foraging; Spatial variation	ANTARCTIC FUR SEALS; KING-GEORGE ISLAND; STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSES; FORAGING ECOLOGY; TROPHIC ECOLOGY; MARINE MAMMALS; JUVENILE SOUTHERN; MACQUARIE ISLAND; CEPHALOPOD DIET; HARBOR SEALS	Quantifying the foraging ecology of apex predators is crucial for understanding the predator-prey interactions in marine ecosystems. This is particularly important in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, where year-round studies are logistically and financially impractical. Detailed investigations into the diet of wide-ranging southern hemisphere marine predators, therefore, need to be quantified spatio-temporally. We coupled tracking data with fatty acid signature analysis (FASA) to investigate the foraging ecology of a wide-ranging Southern Ocean marine predator, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina). Seal foraging areas varied spatially and over time, but seals concentrated their activities in three broad geographic regions (i) off the East Antarctic Continental Shelf (S-ACC), (ii) at the edge of the pack ice north of the Ross Sea (SE-RS) and (iii) north of the Sub-Antarctic Front (SE-SAF). There were significant differences in the fatty acid (FA) composition of the blubber from the seals that used these different regions. Seals foraging in the SE-SAF had blubber high in short chained mono-unsaturated fatty acids (SC-MUFAs), compared to those from the S-ACC and SE-RS habitats, which contained more poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Comparisons with FAs of known prey species in the region indicated that blubber collected from seals using the shelf and pelagic habitats (i.e. S-ACC and SE-SAP) were likely to have higher proportions of fish in the diet and, conversely, those from the pack-ice habitat (i.e. SE-RS) were more likely to have a cosmopolitan diet, i.e. an evenly mixed diet of fish and squid. Seal diet also varied annually, within the shelf and pelagic habitats changing from a diet relatively high in fish, to a diet relatively high in squid. Coupling tracking data with FASA is a powerful technique to investigate the spatio-temporal variations in the diet of wide-ranging marine predators. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Elasmobranch cognitive ability: using electroreceptive foraging behaviour to demonstrate learning, habituation and memory in a benthic shark	ANIMAL COGNITION			English	Article						Scyliorhinus canicula; Efield; Electroreception; Behavioural adaptation; Search path	RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; LESSER SPOTTED DOGFISH; SPINACHIA-SPINACHIA L; SCYLIORHINUS-CANICULA; NURSE SHARKS; GINGLYMOSTOMA-CIRRATUM; 15-SPINED STICKLEBACK; FEEDING-HABITS; SPATIAL MEMORY; KILLER WHALES	Top predators inhabiting a dynamic environment, such as coastal waters, should theoretically possess sufficient cognitive ability to allow successful foraging despite unpredictable sensory stimuli. The cognition-related hunting abilities of marine mammals have been widely demonstrated. Having been historically underestimated, teleost cognitive abilities have also now been significantly demonstrated. Conversely, the abilities of elasmobranchs have received little attention, despite many species possessing relatively large brains comparable to some mammals. The need to determine what, if any, cognitive ability these globally distributed, apex predators are endowed with has been highlighted recently by questions arising from environmental assessments, specifically whether they are able to learn to distinguish between anthropogenic electric fields and prey bioelectric fields. We therefore used electroreceptive foraging behaviour in a model species, Scyliorhinus canicula (small-spotted catshark), to determine cognitive ability by analysing whether elasmobranchs are able to learn to improve foraging efficiency and remember learned behavioural adaptations. Positive reinforcement, operant conditioning was used to study catshark foraging behaviour towards artificial, prey-type electric fields (Efields). Catsharks rewarded with food for responding to Efields throughout experimental weeks were compared with catsharks that were not rewarded for responding in order to assess behavioural adaptation via learning ability. Experiments were repeated after a 3-week interval with previously rewarded catsharks this time receiving no reward and vice versa to assess memory ability. Positive reinforcement markedly and rapidly altered catshark foraging behaviour. Rewarded catsharks exhibited significantly more interest in the electrical stimulus than unrewarded catsharks. Furthermore, they improved their foraging efficiency over time by learning to locate and bite the electrodes to gain food more quickly. In contrast, unrewarded catsharks showed some habituation, whereby their responses to the electrodes abated and eventually entirely ceased, though they generally showed no changes in most foraging parameters. Behavioural adaptations were not retained after the interval suggesting learned behaviour was not memorised beyond the interval. Sequences of individual catshark search paths clearly illustrated learning and habituation behavioural adaptation. This study demonstrated learning and habituation occurring after few foraging events and a memory window of between 12 h and 3 weeks. These cognitive abilities are discussed in relation to diet, habitat, ecology and anthropogenic Efield sources.

Understanding patterns and processes in models of trophic cascades	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Bottom-up; density dependence; food chain; food web; harvesting; model; predator-prey; simulation; top-down	MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; PELAGIC FOOD WEBS; BOTTOM-UP FORCES; TOP-DOWN; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; REGIME-SHIFTS; COMMUNITY REGULATION; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; POSSIBLE MECHANISMS; POPULATION CONTROL	Climate fluctuations and human exploitation are causing global changes in nutrient enrichment of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and declining abundances of apex predators. The resulting trophic cascades have had profound effects on food webs, leading to significant economic and societal consequences. However, the strength of cascades-that is the extent to which a disturbance is diminished as it propagates through a food web-varies widely between ecosystems, and there is no formal theory as to why this should be so. Some food chain models reproduce cascade effects seen in nature, but to what extent is this dependent on their formulation? We show that inclusion of processes represented mathematically as density-dependent regulation of either consumer uptake or mortality rates is necessary for the generation of realistic top-down' cascades in simple food chain models. Realistically modelled bottom-up' cascades, caused by changing nutrient input, are also dependent on the inclusion of density dependence, but especially on mortality regulation as a caricature of, e.g. disease and parasite dynamics or intraguild predation. We show that our conclusions, based on simple food chains, transfer to a more complex marine food web model in which cascades are induced by varying river nutrient inputs or fish harvesting rates.

A product of its environment: the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) exhibits physiological tolerance to elevated environmental CO2	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; ecophysiology; elasmobranch; hypoxia tolerance; ocean acidification		Ocean acidification, resulting from increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, is predicted to affect the physiological performance of many marine species. Recent studies have shown substantial reductions in aerobic performance in some teleost fish species, but no change or even enhanced performance in others. Notably lacking, however, are studies on the effects of near-future CO2 conditions on larger meso and apex predators, such as elasmobranchs. The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) lives on shallow coral reef flats and in lagoons, where it may frequently encounter short-term periods of environmental hypoxia and elevated CO2, especially during nocturnal low tides. Indeed, H. ocellatum is remarkably tolerant to short periods (hours) of hypoxia, and possibly hypercapnia, but nothing is known about its response to prolonged exposure. We exposed H. ocellatum individuals to control (390 mu atm) or one of two near-future CO2 treatments (600 or 880 mu atm) for a minimum of 60 days and then measured key aspects of their respiratory physiology, namely the resting oxygen consumption rate, which is used to estimate resting metabolic rate, and critical oxygen tension, a proxy for hypoxia sensitivity. Neither of these respiratory attributes was affected by the long-term exposure to elevated CO2. Furthermore, there was no change in citrate synthase activity, a cellular indicator of aerobic energy production. Plasma bicarbonate concentrations were significantly elevated in sharks exposed to 600 and 880 mu atm CO2 treatments, indicating that acidosis was probably prevented by regulatory changes in acid-base relevant ions. Epaulette sharks may therefore possess adaptations that confer tolerance to CO2 levels projected to occur in the ocean by the end of this century. It remains uncertain whether other elasmobranchs, especially pelagic species that do not experience such diurnal fluctuations in their environment, will be equally tolerant.	[Heinrich, Dennis D.

J	Isbell, F; Loreau, M				Isbell, Forest; Loreau, Michel			Human impacts on minimum subsets of species critical for maintaining ecosystem structure	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Food web; Marine; Control theory; Network theory; Fishing; Conservation	RESOURCE CONTROL; PLANT DIVERSITY; NITROGEN-CYCLE; FOOD WEBS; BIODIVERSITY; CONSUMER; SERVICES	Humans have indirectly influenced species at lower trophic levels by driving losses of apex consumers. Furthermore, humans have indirectly influenced species at higher trophic levels by driving losses of primary producers. Beyond these broad classes of apex consumers and primary producers, it remains challenging to identify minimum subsets of species that are particularly important for maintaining ecosystem structure and functioning. here we use a novel method at the intersection of control theory and network theory to identify a minimum set of driver node species upon which ecosystem structure strongly depends. Specifically, humans could unintentionally, completely restructure ecosystems (i.e., change species abundances from any initial values to any final values, including zero) by altering the abundances of these few critical driver node species. We then quantify the proportion of these driver nodes that arc influenced by humans, top predators, and primary producers in several marine food webs, We find that humans could unintentionally completely restructure marine food webs while only directly influencing less than one in four species. Additionally, humans directly influence: (1) most or all of the species necessary to completely restructure each network, (2) more driver nodes than top predators, and at least as many driver nodes as primary producers, and (3) an increasing proportion of driver nodes over time in the Adriatic Sea. We conclude that humans have potentially huge impacts on marine ecosystems while directly influencing only the relatively small subset of species that are currently fished. It may be possible to reduce unintentional and undesirable cascading human influences by decreasing human impacts on driver node species in these and other food webs.

Complex wasp-waist regulation of pelagic ecosystems in the Pacific Ocean	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES			English	Article						Ecopath; Ecosim; Ecosystem modelling; Top-down; Bottom-up; Wasp-waist	SOUTHERN BENGUELA ECOSYSTEM; MARINE FOOD WEBS; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; UPWELLING ECOSYSTEMS; TROPHIC CASCADES; YELLOWFIN TUNA; FISHERIES; DYNAMICS; ZOOPLANKTON	'Wasp-waist' control of marine ecosystems is driven by a combination of top-down and bottom-up forcing by a few abundant short-lived species occupying intermediate trophic levels that form a narrow 'waist' through which energy flow from low to high trophic levels is controlled. It has been assumed that wasp-waist control occurs primarily in highly productive and species-poor systems (e.g. upwelling regions). Two large, species-rich, pelagic ecosystems in the relatively oligotrophic eastern and western Pacific Ocean also show wasp-waist-like structure, in that short-lived and fast-growing cephalopods and fishes at intermediate trophic levels comprise the vast majority of the biomass. Possible forcing dynamics of these systems were examined using ecosystem models by altering the biomass of phytoplankton (bottom-up forcing), large pelagic predators (top-down forcing), and intermediate 'wasp-waist' functional groups independently and observing how these changes propagated throughout the ecosystem. The largest effects were seen when altering the biomass of mid trophic-level epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes, where dramatic trophic cascades occurred both upward and downward in the system. We conclude that the high productivity and standing biomass of animals at intermediate trophic levels has a strong top-down influence on the abundance of primary producers. Furthermore, their importance as prey for large predators results in bottom-up controls on populations at higher trophic levels. We show that these tropical pelagic ecosystems possess a complex structure whereby several waist groups and alternate trophic pathways from primary producers to apex predators can cause unpredictable effects when the biomasses of particular functional groups are altered. Such models highlight the possible structuring mechanisms in pelagic systems, which have implications for fisheries that exploit these wasp-waist groups, such as squid fisheries, as well as for fisheries of top predators such as tunas and billfishes that prey upon wasp-waist species.

PCB concentrations predicted in male and female bottlenose dolphin were in good agreement with observed tissue concentrations corroborating the reliability of the model performance and its utility in gaining a more complete view of risk. The modeled cumulative distribution of Sigma PCB concentrations for the population with a breakdown into juvenile, adult male, and female subclasses ranged from 3600 to 144,400 ng/g lipid with 66% to >80% of the population exceeding the established threshold for adverse health effects of 17,000 ng/g lipid. The model estimated that a dietary PCB concentration not exceeding 5.1 ng/g wet wt would be required to reach a condition where 95% of the population would have tissue levels below the health effect threshold. The IB model for PCBs in bottlenose dolphins provides a novel approach to estimating the maximum acceptable dietary concentration for PCBs, a central and important factor to protect these apex predators. The model also enables effective prediction of concentrations in dolphins from fish contaminant surveys which are logistically easier and less costly to collect.

The loss of large-bodied herbivores and/or top predators has been associated with large-scale changes in ecosystems around the world, but there remain important questions regarding the contexts in which such changes are most likely and the mechanisms through which they occur, particularly in marine ecosystems. We used long-term exclusion cages to examine the effects of large grazers (sea cows, Dugong dugon; sea turtles Chelonia mydas) on seagrass community structure, biomass and nutrient dynamics. Experiments were conducted in habitats with high risk of predation (interior of shallow banks) and lower risk (edges of banks) to elucidate whether nonconsumptive (risk) effects of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a roving predator, structure herbivore impacts on seagrasses. In lower-risk habitats, excluding large herbivores resulted in increased leaf length for Cymodocea angustata and Halodule uninervis. C.angustata shoot densities nearly tripled when released from herbivory, while H.uninervis nearly disappeared from exclusion cages over the course of the study. We found no support for the hypothesis that grazing increases seagrass nutrient content. Instead, phosphorus content was higher in seagrasses within exclosures. This pattern is consistent with decreased light availability in the denser C.angustata canopies that formed in exclosures, and may indicate that competition for light led to the decrease in H.uninervis. Impacts of large grazers were consistent with a behaviour-mediated trophic cascade (BMTC) initiated by tiger sharks and mediated by risk-sensitive foraging by large grazers. Our results suggest that large-bodied grazers likely played important roles in seagrass ecosystem dynamics historically and that roving predators are capable of initiating a BMTC. Conservation efforts in coastal ecosystems must account for such interactions or risk unintended consequences.

Comparative Feeding Ecology of Bull Sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) in the Coastal Waters of the Southwest Indian Ocean Inferred from Stable Isotope Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							APEX PREDATORY SHARKS; TROPHIC POSITION; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; SOUTHERN AFRICA; FLORIDA ESTUARY; HABITAT USE; FOOD-WEB; DIET; FISHES; CONSERVATION	As apex predators, sharks play an important role shaping their respective marine communities through predation and associated risk effects. Understanding the predatory dynamics of sharks within communities is, therefore, necessary to establish effective ecologically based conservation strategies. We employed non-lethal sampling methods to investigate the feeding ecology of bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) using stable isotope analysis within a subtropical marine community in the southwest Indian Ocean. The main objectives of this study were to investigate and compare the predatory role that sub-adult and adult bull sharks play within a top predatory teleost fish community. Bull sharks had significantly broader niche widths compared to top predatory teleost assemblages with a wide and relatively enriched range of delta C-13 values relative to the local marine community. This suggests that bull sharks forage from a more diverse range of delta C-13 sources over a wider geographical range than the predatory teleost community. Adult bull sharks appeared to exhibit a shift towards consistently higher trophic level prey from an expanded foraging range compared to sub-adults, possibly due to increased mobility linked with size. Although predatory teleost fish are also capable of substantial migrations, bull sharks may have the ability to exploit a more diverse range of habitats and appeared to prey on a wider diversity of larger prey. This suggests that bull sharks play an important predatory role within their respective marine communities and adult sharks in particular may shape and link ecological processes of a variety of marine communities over a broad range.

Effects of Crude Oil Exposure on Bioaccumulation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Survival of Adult and Larval Stages of Gelatinous Zooplankton	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CTENOPHORE MNEMIOPSIS-LEIDYI; WATER-SOLUBLE FRACTIONS; COPEPOD OITHONA-DAVISAE; AURELIA SP SCYPHOZOA; GULF-OF-MEXICO; NO-2 FUEL OIL; PETROLEUM-HYDROCARBONS; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; FOOD-WEB; PHOTOENHANCED TOXICITY	Gelatinous zooplankton play an important role in marine food webs both as major consumers of metazooplankton and as prey of apex predators (e. g., tuna, sunfish, sea turtles). However, little is known about the effects of crude oil spills on these important components of planktonic communities. We determined the effects of Louisiana light sweet crude oil exposure on survival and bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in adult stages of the scyphozoans Pelagia noctiluca and Aurelia aurita and the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, and on survival of ephyra larvae of A. aurita and cydippid larvae of M. leidyi, in the laboratory. Adult P. noctiluca showed 100% mortality at oil concentration >= 20 mu L L-1 after 16 h. In contrast, low or non-lethal effects were observed on adult stages of A. aurita and M. leidyi exposed at oil concentration <= 25 mu L L-1 after 6 days. Survival of ephyra and cydippid larva decreased with increasing crude oil concentration and exposition time. The median lethal concentration (LC50) for ephyra larvae ranged from 14.41 to 0.15 mu L L-1 after 1 and 3 days, respectively. LC50 for cydippid larvae ranged from 14.52 to 8.94 mu L L-1 after 3 and 6 days, respectively. We observed selective bioaccumulation of chrysene, phenanthrene and pyrene in A. aurita and chrysene, pyrene, benzo[a] pyrene, benzo[b] fluoranthene, benzo[k] fluoranthene, and benzo[a] anthracene in M. leidyi. Overall, our results indicate that (1) A. aurita and M. leidyi adults had a high tolerance to crude oil exposure compared to other zooplankton, whereas P. noctiluca was highly sensitive to crude oil, (2) larval stages of gelatinous zooplankton were more sensitive to crude oil than adult stages, and (3) some of the most toxic PAHs of crude oil can be bioaccumulated in gelatinous zooplankton and potentially be transferred up the food web and contaminate apex predators.

Seasonal abundance, philopatry and demographic structure of Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi) assemblages in the north-east Exuma Sound, The Bahamas	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							DE-NORONHA ARCHIPELAGO; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; GULF-OF-MEXICO; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; PELAGIC SHARKS; LEMON SHARKS; HABITAT USE; CONSERVATION; ATLANTIC	The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), an abundant coral-reef-associated apex predator, is one of the most economically and ecologically important, yet least studied species of large shark in the greater Caribbean region. The relative abundance and population structure of C. perezi off Cape Eleuthera, The Bahamas, was surveyed by standardised longline surveys from May 2008 to October 2011, which resulted in the capture of 331 sharks. Abundance peaked in the summer and was lowest during the winter. Females were 1.6 times more abundant than males and the assemblage was dominated by immature female sharks (45.5 %). The abundance of mature male and female sharks peaked a month apart in June and August, respectively. All 331 sharks were tagged and released with 15.4 % being recaptured after periods at liberty between 5 and 1,159 days (Mean = 333.4 +/- A 42.7 SE). The mean distance between tagging and recapture was 1.77 km for recaptures in excess of 6 months, indicating seasonally stratified philopatry in this species. C. perezi inhabiting Bahamian waters have developed complex habitat use patterns that are both spatiotemporally and demographically segregated, most probably in response to the large and diverse habitat mosaic available on the Bahamas Banks compared to contemporary study sites. This study represents an important step in understanding the spatiotemporal population structure of C. perezi and illustrates the potential for studies examining behavioural plasticity in response to environmental variation and anthropogenic disturbance.

The status of coral reef ecology research in the Red Sea	CORAL REEFS			English	Review						Apex predators; Connectivity; Coral bleaching; Coral reproduction; Herbivory; Marine protected area; Porifera; Reef-associated bacteria	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANTIPREDATORY DEFENSES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CARIBBEAN SPONGES; INDO-PACIFIC; PHASE-SHIFTS; BAND DISEASE	The Red Sea has long been recognized as a region of high biodiversity and endemism. Despite this diversity and early history of scientific work, our understanding of the ecology of coral reefs in the Red Sea has lagged behind that of other large coral reef systems. We carried out a quantitative assessment of ISI-listed research published from the Red Sea in eight specific topics (apex predators, connectivity, coral bleaching, coral reproductive biology, herbivory, marine protected areas, non-coral invertebrates and reef-associated bacteria) and compared the amount of research conducted in the Red Sea to that from Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and the Caribbean. On average, for these eight topics, the Red Sea had 1/6th the amount of research compared to the GBR and about 1/8th the amount of the Caribbean. Further, more than 50 % of the published research from the Red Sea originated from the Gulf of Aqaba, a small area (< 2 % of the area of the Red Sea) in the far northern Red Sea. We summarize the general state of knowledge in these eight topics and highlight the areas of future research priorities for the Red Sea region. Notably, data that could inform science-based management approaches are badly lacking in most Red Sea countries. The Red Sea, as a geologically "young" sea located in one of the warmest regions of the world, has the potential to provide insight into pressing topics such as speciation processes as well as the capacity of reef systems and organisms to adapt to global climate change. As one of the world's most biodiverse coral reef regions, the Red Sea may yet have a significant role to play in our understanding of coral reef ecology at a global scale.	[Berumen, M. L.; Hoey, A.

This study uses National Marine Fisheries Service longline survey data from 1998-2011 to explore spatial and temporal trends in killer whale depredation and to quantify the effect of killer whale depredation on catches of six groundfish species within three management areas in Alaska: the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Western Gulf of Alaska. When killer whales were present during survey gear retrieval, whales removed an estimated 54-72% of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), 41-84% of arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) and 73% (Bering Sea only) of Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Effects on Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) were significant in the Western Gulf only with 51% and 46% reductions, respectively. Overall catches (depredated and non-depredated sets) for all groundfish species significantly impacted by killer whale depredation were lower by 9-28% (p, 0.05). Effects on shortspine thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) catches were not significant in any management area (p. 0.05). These results provide insight into the potential impacts of killer whale depredation on fish stock abundance indices and commercially important fisheries in Alaska and will inform future research on apex predator-fisheries interactions.

The extreme fossil richness of the Maastrichtian Phosphates of Morocco provides insights into the systematic diversity of the latest mosasaurs where about ten species are known. However, data of the coeval plesiosaurs are comparatively scarce. Up to now, only one species, the elasmosaurid Zarafasaura oceanis, is known. Here we describe new elasmosaurid plesiosaur post-cranial material from the Maastrichtian of the Oulad Abdoun Basin (Morocco) that provides new data about the taxonomical and morphological diversity of plesiosaurs in this area. Most of the new material consists of vertebrae that likely belong to a unique elasmosaurid taxon and differ from all other elasmosaurids documented so far. As Zarafasaura is known only from cranial material, it cannot be determined whether the new material may be assigned to this taxon. The new material shows that the latest Cretaceous plesiosaurs in this low latitude area (about 20 degrees N) were rather grade, most likely piscivorous taxa that occupied ecological niches similar to those of rather small mosasaurs (e.g., Halisaurus and "Platecarpus" ptychodon) but distinct from those of most coeval large mosasaur taxa. These plesiosaur fossils are also remarkable in that they consist of both juvenile and adult specimens, suggesting limited segregation between individuals of different ontogenetic stages, a feature that might be attributed to upwelling-related, high nutrient input and food availability in this area during the Maastrichtian. Moreover, the possible occurrence, with older specimens, of a neonate specimen - one among the very few known worldwide - suggests a possible social structure organization. The new data contribute to increase our understanding of Late Cretaceous plesiosaur biodiversity and provide new insights into the ecology of latest Cretaceous marine apex predators.

Energy requirements of Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) as predicted by a bioenergetic model	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY			English	Article						apex predator; bioenergetic model; dolphin energetics; food consumption; Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; marine mammal physiology; Pacific white-sided dolphin; prey biomass	STELLER SEA LIONS; EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC; WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; ASSIMILATION EFFICIENCY; PHOCA-GROENLANDICA; DIGESTIVE EFFICIENCY; TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS; EUMETOPIAS-JUBATUS; PREY CONSUMPTION; DIFFERENT DIETS	Apex predators such as Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) have the potential to impact prey populations and to be affected by changes in prey abundance. As abundant predators that range widely across the North Pacific Ocean, their interactions with prey populations may have conservation implications. The energy required by individual Pacific white-sided dolphins was estimated using a bioenergetic model that accounted for different age classes and reproductive stages (calf, juvenile, adult, pregnant, and lactating). Monte Carlo simulations incorporating variability in model parameters (i.e., body mass, growth rate, costs of gestation and lactation, metabolic rate, cost of activity, and assimilation efficiencies) were used to predict ranges in energetic requirements of this species. Mean (+/- SD) total energy requirements in MJ/day were 40.3 +/- 6.2 for calves, 70.8 +/- 8.2 for juveniles, 69.0 +/- 3.6 for adults, 70.3 +/- 3.6 for pregnant females, and 98.4 +/- 20.0 for lactating females. Estimates of energy requirements were most sensitive to uncertainty in values used for resting metabolic rates and energetic costs of activity. Estimated mass-specific energy requirements in MJ kg(-1) day(-1) were elevated in calves (1.55 +/- 0.23), juveniles (0.97 +/- 0.11), and lactating females (1.01 +/- 0.21) when compared with nonreproductive adults and pregnant females (similar to 0.71 +/- 0.04). Based on a high-energy diet, an average-sized dolphin (78 kg) would consume approximately 12.5-15.8 kg of fish or 16-20% of its body mass per day. These high energetic requirements may indicate a reliance of dolphins on energy-rich prey, which has implications for fisheries management and conservation of marine mammals.

An expedition to Salas y Gomez and Easter islands was conducted to develop a comprehensive baseline of the nearshore marine ecosystem, to survey seamounts of the recently created Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park (MMHMP) - a no-take marine reserve of 150 000km(2) - and to compare these results with Easter Island where the marine ecosystem is similar but has no marine protection. 2. Live coral cover was surprisingly high at both Easter Island (53%) and Salas y Gomez (44%), especially considering their sub-tropical location, high wave energy environments, and geographic isolation. 3. Endemic and regionally-endemic species comprised 77% of the fish abundance at Easter Island and 73% at Salas y Gomez. Fish biomass at Salas y Gomez was relatively high (1.2tha(-1)) and included a large proportion of apex predators (43%), whereas at Easter Island it was almost three times lower (0.45tha(-1)) with large predators accounting for less than 2% of the biomass, despite good habitat quality. 4. The large cohort of small sharks and the absence of larger sharks at Salas y Gomez suggest mesopredator release consistent with recent shark fishing. The fish fauna at the seamounts between Easter Island and Salas y Gomez, outside of MMHMP, harboured 46% endemic species, including a new species of damselfish (Chromis sp. nov.) and probably a new species of Chimaera (Hydrolagus). Numerous seamounts adjacent to Salas y Gomez are currently not included in the MMHMP. 5. This expedition highlights the high biodiversity value of this remote part of the Pacific owing to the uniqueness (endemicity) of the fauna, large apex predator biomass, and geographic isolation.

Seabirds that consume more than one prey type may adjust their foraging to maintain provisioning rates for their chicks. How energetically effective are these strategies, and what are the implications for the management of seabirds and their marine habitat? 2. A multi-species functional response links consumption rates to the availability of multiple prey types, but fitting multi-species functional responses to field data can be difficult, requiring consumption measurements over a range of different prey abundances. Such detailed data may be especially difficult to obtain in marine ecosystems. 3. We used annual time-series data on chick provisioning for the common guillemot Uria aalge together with abundance indices for its two main prey (lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus and sprat Sprattus sprattus) to parameterize a multi-species functional response for parents provisioning chicks at a major North Sea colony from 1992 to 2005. 4. The fitted model reproduced changes in diet and consumption rate which were consistent with changes in local prey abundance including a long-term decline in sandeels. 5. The model predicted that energy intake by chicks would be more sensitive to changes in sprat abundance than sandeel abundance. Guillemots appeared able to adjust their foraging tactics over a wide range of prey abundances to maintain a consistent energetic intake rate for chicks. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest guillemot chicks obtain adequate calorific intake from their parents despite fluctuating prey abundances, conferring some resilience in the face of environmental variation. The parameterized multi-species functional response model can be used to estimate levels of severe prey shortage that compromise provisioning. It also enables us to interpret predator consumption rates so that these can be used as a metric of prey availability. Further, quantifying trophic links between marine prey and apex predators is needed to support the development of multi-species models in which the predators can be included. Such models are needed as tools to effectively manage the marine ecosystem, taking into account the objectives of fishing, conservation and the need to maintain Good Environmental Status.

Evidence for benthic primary production support of an apex predator-dominated coral reef food web	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							NORTHWESTERN HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS; FRENCH FRIGATE SHOALS; STABLE-ISOTOPE RATIOS; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; NITROGEN ISOTOPES; TROPHIC POSITION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MIXING MODELS; NEW-CALEDONIA; DELTA-N-15	Five hundred and ninety-nine primary producers and consumers in the PapahAnaumokuAkea Marine National Monument (PMNM) (22A degrees N-30A degrees N, 160A degrees W-180A degrees W) were sampled for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition to elucidate trophic relationships in a relatively unimpacted, apex predator-dominated coral reef ecosystem. A one-isotope (delta C-13), two-source (phytoplankton and benthic primary production) mixing model provided evidence for an average minimum benthic primary production contribution of 65 % to consumer production. Primary producer delta N-15 values ranged from -1.6 to 8.0 aEuro degrees with an average (2.1 aEuro degrees) consistent with a prevalence of N-2 fixation. Consumer group delta N-15 means ranged from 6.6 aEuro degrees (herbivore) to 12.1 aEuro degrees (Galeocerdo cuvier), and differences between consumer group delta N-15 values suggest an average trophic enrichment factor of 1.8 aEuro degrees Delta N-15. Based on relative delta N-15 values, the larger G. cuvier may feed at a trophic position above other apex predators. The results provide baseline data for investigating the trophic ecology of healthy coral reef ecosystems.

Using the jaw-motion recorders in conjunction with satellite tracking data, we first reveal the three-dimensional fine-scale distribution of deep foraging activity in the north-east Pacific Ocean. A large number of jaw-motion events (2381758766 during 29254178 dives, per seal) were observed with diel patterns suggesting their dependency on small mesopelagic prey. Calculations using at-sea field metabolic-rate and the photographs concurrently obtained by the head-mounted camera indicated feeding on small mesopelagic prey (1020g) including lantern fish (F. Myctophidae). The foraging behaviour of the northern elephant seal contrasts with echolocating toothed whales, which make fewer feeding attempts, suggesting the whales forage more selectively. We hypothesize that the continuous diving mode exhibited by this seal could be attributed to their reliance on small prey and their less efficient passive sensors' for prey search, that is, their vision or whiskers to detect prey.

Evidence of Maternal Offloading of Organic Contaminants in White Sharks (Carcharodon carcharias)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BREEDING GLAUCOUS GULLS; FINNED PILOT WHALES; ORGANOCHLORINE COMPOUNDS; SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; MARINE MAMMALS; KILLER WHALES; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; REPRODUCTIVE TRANSFER; DERMOCHELYS-CORIACEA; LEATHERBACK TURTLES	Organic contaminants were measured in young of the year (YOY) white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) incidentally caught in southern California between 2005 and 2012 (n = 20) and were found to be unexpectedly high considering the young age and dietary preferences of young white sharks, suggesting these levels may be due to exposure in utero. To assess the potential contributions of dietary exposure to the observed levels, a five-parameter bioaccumulation model was used to estimate the total loads a newborn shark would potentially accumulate in one year from consuming contaminated prey from southern California. Maximum simulated dietary accumulation of DDTs and PCBs were 25.1 and 4.73 mu g/g wet weight (ww) liver, respectively. Observed Sigma DDT and Sigma PCB concentrations (95 +/- 91 mu g/g and 16 +/- 10 mu g/g ww, respectively) in a majority of YOY sharks were substantially higher than the model predictions suggesting an additional source of contaminant exposure beyond foraging. Maternal offloading of organic contaminants during reproduction has been noted in other apex predators, but this is the first evidence of transfer in a matrotrophic shark. While there are signs of white shark population recovery in the eastern Pacific, the long-term physiological and population level consequences of biomagnification and maternal offloading of environmental contaminants in white sharks is unclear.

Results provide an ecosystem perspective of Australia's largest fishery, the South Australian sardine fishery, by placing its establishment and growth in the context of other dynamic changes in the ecosystem, including: the development of other fisheries; changing abundances of apex predator populations and oceanographic change. We investigated the potential impacts of the sardine fishery on high tropic level predators, particularly land-breeding seals and seabirds which may be suitable ecological performance indicators of ecosystem health. Results indicate that despite the rapid growth of the sardine fishery since 1991, there has likely been a negligible fishery impact on other modelled groups, suggesting that current levels of fishing effort are not impacting negatively on the broader ecosystem structure and function in the eastern Great Australian Bight. Results highlight the importance of small pelagic fish to higher trophic levels, the trophic changes that have resulted from loss and recovery of apex predator populations, and the potential pivotal role of cephalopod biomass in regulating 'bottom-up' trophic processes. The ability to resolve and attribute potential impacts from multiple fisheries, other human impacts and ecological change in this poorly understood region is highlighted by the study, and will be critical to ensure future ecologically sustainable development within the region.

J	Fallows, C; Gallagher, AJ; Hammerschlag, N				Fallows, Chris; Gallagher, Austin J.; Hammerschlag, Neil			White Sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) Scavenging on Whales and Its Potential Role in Further Shaping the Ecology of an Apex Predator	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; AFRICAN WILD DOGS; SOUTH-AFRICA; DEEP-SEA; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; FALSE-BAY; FOOD-WEB; ISLAND; COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS	Scavenging, a result of a temporary pulse of resources, occurs in virtually all ecosystems containing carnivores, and is an important energy transfer pathway that can impact ecosystem structure and function, and this ecological significance has largely been considered from a terrestrial standpoint; however, little is known about the role of scavenging in shaping the behavioral ecology of marine species, specifically apex predators. Here we present findings from multiple opportunistic observations of white sharks scavenging on whale carcasses in False Bay, South Africa. Observations of white sharks scavenging over successive days provided evidence of strategic and selective scavenging by this species. Moreover, extended daily observations permitted recordings of unique social, aggregative, and feeding behaviors. We further compare these data against observations of natural predation by sharks on seals in the study area. We discuss these data in relation to environmental conditions, shark social interactions, migration patterns, whale biology, and behaviorally-mediated trophic cascades. While the appearance of a whale carcass is largely a stochastic event, we propose that white shark scavenging on whales may represent an underestimated, yet significant component to the overall foraging ecology of this species, especially as individuals attain sexual maturity.

William			Trophic Level Stability-Inducing Effects of Predaceous Early Juvenile Fish in an Estuarine Mesocosm Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PLANKTONIC FOOD WEBS; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; COMMUNITY STABILITY; ANIMAL POPULATIONS; CASCADES; ECOSYSTEMS; MARINE	Background: Classically, estuarine planktonic research has focussed largely on the physico-chemical drivers of community assemblages leaving a paucity of information on important biological interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Within the context of trophic cascades, various treatments using in situ mesocosms were established in a closed estuary to highlight the importance of predation in stabilizing estuarine plankton abundances. Through either the removal (filtration) or addition of certain planktonic groups, five different trophic systems were established. These treatments contained varied numbers of trophic levels and thus different "predators" at the top of the food chain. The abundances of zooplankton (copepod and polychaete), ciliate, micro-flagellate, nano-flagellate and bacteria were investigated in each treatment, over time. The reference treatment containing apex zooplanktivores (early juvenile mullet) and plankton at natural densities mimicked a natural, stable state of an estuary. Proportional variability (PV) and coefficient of variation (CV) of temporal abundances were calculated for each taxon and showed that apex predators in this experimental ecosystem, when compared to the other systems, induced stability. The presence of these predators therefore had consequences for multiple trophic levels, consistent with trophic cascade theory. Conclusions/Significance: PV and CV proved useful indices for comparing stability. Apex predators exerted a stabilizing pressure through feeding on copepods and polychaetes which cascaded through the ciliates, micro-flagellates, nano-flagellates and bacteria.

J	Thiebot, JB; Weimerskirch, H				Thiebot, Jean-Baptiste; Weimerskirch, Henri			Contrasted associations between seabirds and marine mammals across four biomes of the southern Indian Ocean	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY			English	Article						Foraging strategies; Interspecific interactions; Marine predators; Bootstrap procedure; At-sea observations; Long-term monitoring	PETRELS PROCELLARIA-AEQUINOCTIALIS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PRODUCTIVITY GRADIENT; TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT; EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; ANTARCTIC KRILL; PACK-ICE; SEA; DOLPHINS; WHITE	Seabirds associations with marine mammals have been shown to be an efficient way by which the seabirds can detect and access prey patches. However, these associations have been documented locally in the literature and their relevance at the ecosystem level is unknown, mostly because they constitute relatively rare events and therefore few appropriate data exist. In this study, we aimed at quantifying and qualifying these interactions, based on long-term standardised at-sea observations carried out from 1978 to 2005 in the whole southern Indian Ocean. We(1) investigated whether the observed interspecific associations between foraging seabirds and marine mammals could be distinguished from chance using a bootstrap method, and(2) compared their occurrences between four oceanic biomes sampled(tropical, subtropical, subantarctic, Antarctic). Although in our data we could not discriminate active association versus aggregation of species feeding on the same prey patches, our results indicate that, in each biome, 5-10 seabird species were more frequently associated with marine mammals than expected due to chance. Tropical birds appeared to be associated almost exclusively with Delphinidae schools, whereas in the subtropical waters, all the significant associations occurred with marine mammals others than dolphins. In the subantarctic biome, seabirds were mostly associated with Pinnipeds, and the highly productive Antarctic waters provided opportunities for diverse but rare associations. This study suggests that the ecological links between foraging predators can be measured using a randomisation method, and provides conclusive and comparative information on the ecology of apex trophic levels organisms from pelagic communities.

Minimum population size estimates demonstrate an increase in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) on Livingston Island, maritime Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Antarctica; Breeding population; Byers Peninsula; Mirounga leonina; Pup	KING-GEORGE-ISLAND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; PENINSULA; SURVIVAL; DYNAMICS	Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are apex predators of marine Antarctic food webs, and variations in their populations have been linked to environmental changes. Consequently, measuring and reporting the status of elephant seal populations provide insights into the environmental status of Antarctica. Here, we present new information on the size of the elephant seal subpopulation on Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, maritime Antarctica). Based on a total count of 1,510 pups, we estimated a total subpopulation size of 5,530 individuals by using a conversion factor of 3.5. This represents an increase of 150 % since the subpopulation was first counted 30 years ago. Based on this finding, we hypothesize that the overall South Georgia stock, to which the subpopulation we estimated on Byers Peninsula belongs, could be increasing instead of remaining stable as previously thought.

Temporal and biological comparisons of PFAS concentrations were made in great skuas (Stercorarius skua), a marine apex predator. Concentrations of 16 PFASs were quantified, including C4C10 perfluorosulfonates (PFSAs), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), and C5C14 perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs). Concentrations of PFASs (ng/g wet wt) were significantly higher in eggs collected in Shetland in 2008 compared with 1980 for most compounds. However, the magnitude of the differences was small, with a mean increase of 3ng/g. Levels of PFASs in great skuas were low compared with those of other seabirds in similar ecological niches; and in contrast to other contaminants measured in the same eggs, concentrations of PFASs did not correlate with trophic level. Concentrations of PFASs in adult plasma were significantly higher in males than in females for most PFASs. This suggests that maternal transfer through egg laying may be a significant mode of elimination of PFASs in female great skuas. The low concentrations of PFASs in eggs and plasma compared with other halogenated organic contaminants and other species suggest that great skuas do not bioaccumulate PFASs to the same extent as some other seabirds.

Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) use suction and filter feeding when hunting small prey underwater	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Dentition; Foraging behaviour; Pinnipedia; Suction feeding	CRAB-EATER; BEHAVIOR; KINEMATICS; ODONTOCETI; PREDATION; EVOLUTION; CETACEA; WHALES; SIZE; DIET	Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are unusual among apex predators in that they feed at both the top and near the bottom of marine food webs; they capture and consume marine amniotes (seals and penguins) as well as krill. This is thought to be achieved with their unusual dentition: rostral caniniform teeth function to grip large prey and tricuspate postcanines function to sieve krill. The use of canine teeth is known, yet until now, the function of the postcanines has never been documented. Here, we present the first direct observations of filter feeding in leopard seals. Suction was used to draw small prey into the mouth followed by expulsion of ingested seawater through the sieve formed by postcanine teeth. Individuals show abrasive wear on canines and incisors, but not postcanines. This suggests that postcanines are not systematically used for piercing prey during macrophagous feeding, confirming that the postcanines primarily serve a sieving function. Rather than being less efficient at feeding as a result of its polarized diet, the leopard seal is well adapted towards two disparate feeding modes.

However, the highest trophic level of today's marine ecosystems, i.e., macropredatory tetrapods that forage on prey of similar size to their own, was thus far lacking in the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic. Here we report a top-tier tetrapod predator, a very large (>8.6 m) ichthyosaur from the early Middle Triassic (244 Ma), of Nevada. This ichthyosaur had a massive skull and large labiolingually flattened teeth with two cutting edges indicative of a macropredatory feeding style. Its presence documents the rapid evolution of modern marine ecosystems in the Triassic where the same level of complexity as observed in today's marine ecosystems is reached within 8 My after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction and within 4 My of the time reptiles first invaded the sea. This find also indicates that the biotic recovery in the marine realm may have occurred faster compared with terrestrial ecosystems, where the first apex predators may not have evolved before the Carnian.

Despite the restrictions on use and production of many POPs, concern remains about levels of these chemicals present in marine biota due to their potential toxicity. Many seabird species are migratory, and although overwintering area has been hypothesized to affect the accumulation of POPs, few have studied the contribution of exposure in the wintering area on the POP burdens of seabirds. This study investigated the impact of wintering area on concentrations and patterns of organochlorines (OCs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in plasma of breeding great skuas Stercorarius skua from 3 colonies; Bjornoya (Svalbard), southeast Iceland and Shetland (Scotland). To do so, stable isotope values of primary feathers grown during the winter were used in conjunction with geolocator data (n = 16) to assign untracked individuals (n = 122), to 3 wintering areas (America, Europe and Africa). Birds wintering in Africa had lower plasma concentrations of many OCs and PBDE 47 compared to the other areas. Nevertheless, the influence of wintering area differed between contaminants and between breeding colonies. We conclude that although wintering area had a significant effect on both concentrations and patterns of POPs, its influence was small in comparison to differences in exposure to these pollutants at breeding colonies, but that accumulation of POPs during the winter may be important for specific populations of seabirds.

The biomass of sharks, large-bodied piscivores, and secondary invertebrate consumers was expectedly larger in the absence of major human populations. Less intuitively, we report a doubling in the density and biomass of small-bodied acanthurids with significant human presence, whereas large-bodied parrotfishes were halved. These trends provided evidence for prey release of small acanthurids, but also indicated a reduction in grazing function given that power-law relationships govern fish size and physiology. Path analyses supported the conjecture that apex predator biomass enhanced the abundance of large-bodied herbivores, with ensuing benefits to calcifying benthic substrates and coral diversity. Human populations, as low as 40 individuals, had opposing linked interactions. The study next used species abundances to depict food chain interaction strengths, and multivariate measures of heterogeneity to depict food chain diversity. The removal of few strong links along the gradient of investigation (i.e. Acropora corals and sharks), as well as numerous weak links, was associated with fish assemblages and benthic substrates that had reduced grazing and calcification potential, respectively. The results inferred that a reduction in the functional response time of trophic guilds will follow perturbations (i.e. reduce stability), synonymous to food webs with low return rates to their modeled, stable con figuration. This study provides a broader perspective for interpreting how humans and apex predators influence ecological stability across (RMI) coral reef ecosystems.

There is, however, little information on the degree of protection by MPAs to shark populations. The movements of individual smoothhound sharks Mustelus mustelus in, and adjacent to, a small (34 km(2)) no-take MPA (Langebaan Lagoon Marine Protected Area; LMPA) situated on the west coast of South Africa were investigated over two years using acoustic telemetry. Sharks spent the majority of the time (in hours, average 79%) inside the reserve, and some sharks (n = 2 of 15 recorded during a full year) did not leave the reserve during the study period. Time spent inside the LMPA and the number of crossings of its boundary were strongly influenced by season. Sharks concentrated inside the LMPA during summer, whereas they were widely distributed throughout the study area during winter. Six sharks left the Saldanha Bay embayment during spring and winter for durations ranging from two to 156 days (median = 111 days). All returned to the bay within the study period. Individuals recorded over two years showed consistency in behavioural patterns and protection by the LMPA between years, and spent an average of 74% and 80% of the time inside the LMPA during the two study years respectively. The extended residency of smoothhound sharks within the LMPA suggests that no-take area protection may be a viable management option.	[da Silva, C.; Kerwath, S. E.; Wilke, C.

Heterotrophic food web, pelagic-benthic coupling, and biodiversity	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							COPEPOD CALANUS-HYPERBOREUS; SOUTHEASTERN BEAUFORT SEA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BALAENA-MYSTICETUS; GREENLAND SEA; BOWHEAD WHALE; ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; BARENTS SEA	As part of the Canadian contribution to the International Polar Year (IPY), several major international research programs have focused on offshore arctic marine ecosystems. The general goal of these projects was to improve our understanding of how the response of arctic marine ecosystems to climate warming will alter food web structure and ecosystem services provided to Northerners. At least four key findings from these projects relating to arctic heterotrophic food web, pelagic-benthic coupling and biodiversity have emerged: (1) Contrary to a long-standing paradigm of dormant ecosystems during the long arctic winter, major food web components showed relatively high level of winter activity, well before the spring release of ice algae and subsequent phytoplankton bloom. Such phenological plasticity among key secondary producers like zooplankton may thus narrow the risks of extreme mismatch between primary production and secondary production in an increasingly variable arctic environment. (2) Tight pelagic-benthic coupling and consequent recycling of nutrients at the seafloor characterize specific regions of the Canadian Arctic, such as the North Water polynya and Lancaster Sound. The latter constitute hot spots of benthic ecosystem functioning compared to regions where zooplankton-mediated processes weaken the pelagic-benthic coupling. (3) In contrast with another widely shared assumption of lower biodiversity, arctic marine biodiversity is comparable to that reported off Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Canada, albeit threatened by the potential colonization of subarctic species. (4) The rapid decrease of summer sea-ice cover allows increasing numbers of killer whales to use the Canadian High Arctic as a hunting ground. The stronger presence of this species, bound to become a new apex predator of arctic seas, will likely affect populations of endemic arctic marine mammals such as the narwhal, bowhead, and beluga whales.

In this study, we quantify the trophic impact of marine mammals and seabirds in the Rio de la Plata estuary based on a previous trophic mass balance model of this estuary. The model comprised 37 functional groups: 3 species of marine mammals (2 cetaceans: Tursiops truncatus, Pontoporia blainvillei and 1 pinniped: Otaria flavescens), 1 coastal bird group comprising 11 species, 17 fish, 12 invertebrates, 2 zooplanktons, 1 phytoplankton, detritus, and 5 fishing fleets. Model results showed that seabirds, O. flavescens and P. blainvillei, are apex predators, with high levels of niche overlap among them, suggesting competition for similar resources such as fish species. Marine mammals and seabirds produce negative effects on commercially important species, while, at the same time, indirect positive effects (increase of the biomass) were also detected in some groups related to trophic cascade effects.

The average total biomass of nearshore fishes was 7.8 tonnes per ha, among the largest observed in the tropics, with apex predators such as sharks, jacks, and groupers accounting for nearly 40% of the total biomass. The abundance of reef and pelagic sharks, particularly large aggregations of threatened species such as the scalloped hammerhead shark (up to 42 hammerheads ha(-1)) and large schools of jacks and snappers show the capacity for high biomass in unfished ecosystems in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. However, the abundance of hammerhead and reef whitetip sharks appears to have been declining since the late 1990s, and likely causes may include increasing fishing pressure on sharks in the region and illegal fishing inside the Park. One Galapagos shark tagged on September 20, 2009 in the Isla del Coco National Park moved 255km southeast towards Malpelo Island in Colombia, when it stopped transmitting. These results contribute to the evidence that sharks conduct large-scale movements between marine protected areas (Isla del Coco, Malpelo, Galapagos) in the Eastern tropical Pacific and emphasize the need for regional-scale management. More than half of the species and 90% of the individuals observed were endemic to the tropical eastern Pacific. These high biomass and endemicity values highlight the uniqueness of the fish assemblage at Isla del Coco and its importance as a global biodiversity hotspot.

J	Dueri, S; Faugeras, B; Maury, O				Dueri, Sibylle; Faugeras, Blaise; Maury, Olivier			Modelling the skipjack tuna dynamics in the Indian Ocean with APECOSM-E: Part 1. Model formulation	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Tropical tuna; Pelagic fishery; Dynamic Energy Budget; Marine ecosystem model	KATSUWONUS-PELAMIS; THUNNUS-ALBACARES; MOVEMENTS; MALDIVES; PACIFIC; RATES	APECOSM-E (Apex-Predator-Ecosystem-Model-Estimation) is a deterministic model that represents the 3D distribution and population dynamics of tropical tuna under the joint effect of environmental conditions and exploitation by fisheries. It is a simplified version of the top predator component of the APECOSM framework, based on a single partial differential equation. The model is structured in 3D space and fish size and considers size dependent reproduction, growth, predation, natural mortality and fishing mortality. Processes are time, space and size-dependent and linked to the environment through mechanistic bioenergetic or behavioral parameterizations. Physiological rates such as growth, reproduction and ageing mortality are derived from the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, while horizontal movements and vertical distribution obey a mechanistically derived advection-diffusion formulation driven by habitat gradients and oceanic currents. The effect of fishing is accounted for through the use of fleet-specific size and depth selectivity functions and time-dependent catchability coefficients which relate observed fishing effort to catches and size-frequencies. In this paper we present the mathematical formulations of the physiological and behavioral components of the model, and an application to the skipjack tuna population in the Indian Ocean. The model is run with a daily time step on a 10 x 10 horizontal grid and considers 20 vertical layers, reaching a maximal depth of 500 m. Results show the effects of spatial and temporal variability of environmental conditions on tuna physiology in terms of growth, reproduction and survival. Moreover, our results suggest that observed trends in reported catches are connected to environmental conditions by means of recruitment dynamics. In addition, the model allows representing the horizontal and vertical distribution of skipjack tuna and assessing the effect of accessibility of the resource to fisheries. The ability of the model to represent the distribution of biomass in accordance with the pattern given by the observed fishing activity was evaluated by comparing the spatial distribution of the simulated biomass with the observed distribution of commercial purse seiners and bait boats catches in the Indian Ocean. The likelihood based method used for estimating the model parameters as well as an analysis of its sensitivity to their values is provided in a companion paper (Dueri et al., 2012).

Influence of Climate Change and Trophic Coupling across Four Trophic Levels in the Celtic Sea	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; HERRING CLUPEA-HARENGUS; PLANKTON RECORDER DATA; LONG-TERM CHANGES; BALTIC SEA; C-HELGOLANDICUS; FISH COMMUNITY; SEABIRDS; ECOSYSTEMS; WEATHER	Climate change has had profound effects upon marine ecosystems, impacting across all trophic levels from plankton to apex predators. Determining the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems requires understanding the direct effects on all trophic levels as well as indirect effects mediated by trophic coupling. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of climate change on the pelagic food web in the Celtic Sea, a productive shelf region in the Northeast Atlantic. Using long-term data, we examined possible direct and indirect 'bottom-up' climate effects across four trophic levels: phytoplankton, zooplankton, mid-trophic level fish and seabirds. During the period 1986-2007, although there was no temporal trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), the decadal mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Celtic Sea increased by 0.66 +/- 0.02 degrees C. Despite this, there was only a weak signal of climate change in the Celtic Sea food web. Changes in plankton community structure were found, however this was not related to SST or NAO. A negative relationship occurred between herring abundance (0- and 1-group) and spring SST ( 0- group: p = 0.02, slope = -0.30560.125; 1-group: p = 0.04, slope = -0.410 +/- 0.193). Seabird demographics showed complex species-specific responses. There was evidence of direct effects of spring NAO ( on black-legged kittiwake population growth rate: p = 0.03, slope = 0.0314 +/- 0.014) as well as indirect bottom- up effects of lagged spring SST (on razorbill breeding success: p = 0.01, slope = -0.144 +/- 0.05). Negative relationships between breeding success and population growth rate of razorbills and common guillemots may be explained by interactions between mid-trophic level fish. Our findings show that the impacts of climate change on the Celtic Sea ecosystem is not as marked as in nearby regions (e.g. the North Sea), emphasizing the need for more research at regional scales.

The Cranial Osteology and Feeding Ecology of the Metriorhynchid Crocodylomorph Genera Dakosaurus and Plesiosuchus from the Late Jurassic of Europe	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL-MORPHOLOGY; TYRANNOSAURID DINOSAURS; ANTORBITAL FENESTRA; PLIOSAUR REPTILIA; SALT-GLANDS; THALATTOSUCHIA; EVOLUTION; MECHANICS; GEOSAURUS; MESOEUCROCODYLIA	Background: Dakosaurus and Plesiosuchus are characteristic genera of aquatic, large-bodied, macrophagous metriorhynchid crocodylomorphs. Recent studies show that these genera were apex predators in marine ecosystems during the latter part of the Late Jurassic, with robust skulls and strong bite forces optimized for feeding on large prey. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we present comprehensive osteological descriptions and systematic revisions of the type species of both genera, and in doing so we resurrect the genus Plesiosuchus for the species Dakosaurus manselii. Both species are diagnosed with numerous autapomorphies. Dakosaurus maximus has premaxillary 'lateral plates'; strongly ornamented maxillae; macroziphodont dentition; tightly fitting tooth-to-tooth occlusion; and extensive macrowear on the mesial and distal margins. Plesiosuchus manselii is distinct in having: non-amblygnathous rostrum; long mandibular symphysis; microziphodont teeth; tooth-crown apices that lack spalled surfaces or breaks; and no evidence for occlusal wear facets. Our phylogenetic analysis finds Dakosaurus maximus to be the sister taxon of the South American Dakosaurus andiniensis, and Plesiosuchus manselii in a polytomy at the base of Geosaurini (the subclade of macrophagous metriorhynchids that includes Dakosaurus, Geosaurus and Torvoneustes). Conclusions/Significance: The sympatry of Dakosaurus and Plesiosuchus is curiously similar to North Atlantic killer whales, which have one larger 'type' that lacks tooth-crown breakage being sympatric with a smaller 'type' that has extensive crown breakage. Assuming this morphofunctional complex is indicative of diet, then Plesiosuchus would be a specialist feeding on other marine reptiles while Dakosaurus would be a generalist and possible suction-feeder. This hypothesis is supported by Plesiosuchus manselii having a very large optimum gape (gape at which multiple teeth come into contact with a prey-item), while Dakosaurus maximus possesses craniomandibular characteristics observed in extant suction-feeding odontocetes: shortened tooth-row, amblygnathous rostrum and a very short mandibular symphysis. We hypothesise that trophic specialisation enabled these two large-bodied species to coexist in the same ecosystem.

J	Martin, JE; Fischer, V; Vincent, P; Suan, G				Martin, Jeremy E.; Fischer, Valentin; Vincent, Peggy; Suan, Guillaume			A longirostrine Temnodontosaurus (Ichthyosauria) with comments on Early Jurassic ichthyosaur niche partitioning and disparity	PALAEONTOLOGY			English	Article						Ichthyosauria; Toarcian; anoxic event; jaw mechanics; Temnodontosaurus	OCEANIC ANOXIC EVENT; MARINE REPTILES; GIANT ICHTHYOSAURS; TOARCIAN; PHYLOGENY; ENGLAND; FRANCE; BASIN	We describe an almost complete ichthyosaur skeleton from the middle Toarcian (Lower Jurassic) of the Beaujolais foothills near Lyon, France, and assign it to Temnodontosaurus azerguensis sp. nov. This new species exhibits cranial peculiarities such as a thin, elongated and possibly edentulous rostrum, as well as a reduced quadrate. These characters indicate dietary preferences that markedly differ from other species referred to Temnodontosaurus, a genus previously considered as the top predator of the Early Jurassic seas. Despite a conservative postcranial skeleton, we propose that Temnodontosaurus is one of the most ecologically disparate genera of ichthyosaurs, including apex predators and now a soft prey longirostrine hunter. Ammonites collected from the same stratigraphic level as the described specimen indicate that the new species is somewhat younger (bifrons ammonite zone) than the most known Toarcian ichthyosaurs and therefore slightly postdates the interval of severe environmental changes and marine invertebrate extinctions known as the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event. The present study therefore raises the question of whether postcrisis recovery of vertebrate faunas, including the radiation of Temnodontosaurus into a new ecological niche, may have been a consequence of marine ecosystem reorganization across this event.

Mercury Concentrations in Hair from Neonatal and Juvenile Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus): Implications Based on Age and Region in this Northern Pacific Marine Sentinel Piscivore	ECOHEALTH			English	Article						mercury; methylmercury; hair; neonate; pup; marine sentinel; Steller sea lion; toxicology; ecotoxicology; ecosystem health	SEQUENTIAL MEGAFAUNAL COLLAPSE; PHOCA-VITULINA-RICHARDII; POLAR BEARS; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; HARBOR SEAL; IN-VITRO; METHYLMERCURY; EXPOSURE; ALASKA	Mercury is a global contaminant of concern for the fetus and the neonate of piscivores. Methylmercury, produced within marine ecosystems, is of particular concern as a readily absorbed neurotoxicant transported across the blood brain barrier and transplacentally. In the North Pacific Ocean, Steller sea lions are broadly distributed apex predators and, as such, integrate complex food webs and the associated exposure and possible adverse effects of toxic and infectious agents. Hair, including lanugo, was examined using regional and age groupings to assess mercury concentrations in young Alaskan Steller sea lions. The highest concentrations of mercury occurred in the youngest animals, likely via in utero exposure. Based on the adverse developmental outcomes of methylmercury toxicity this specific cohort is of concern. Regionally, higher concentrations of mercury were observed in the endangered western population of Steller sea lions and mirrored patterns observed in human biomonitoring studies of Alaskan coastal communities. These data have broader implications with respect to human and ecosystem health as Steller sea lions rely on similar prey species and foraging areas as those targeted by commercial fisheries and subsistence users and are therefore valuable sentinels of marine ecosystem health.

PBDEs have been detected at relatively high concentrations in harbor seals, apex predators in the northwest Atlantic. Whereas tri- to hexa-BDEs readily biomagnified from prey fishes to seal blubber, Deca-BDE (BDE-209) did not biomagnify in blubber. To explore tissue-specific differences in the accumulation/biomagnification of BFRs, we analyzed tri- to Deca-BDES in liver of 56 harbor seals (6 adult males, 50 pups), and compared hepatic concentrations and biomagnification potential with those in blubber. HBCDs were analyzed in seal liver and blubber to enable similar comparisons. Hepatic Sigma PBDE (tri- to Octa-BDE) concentrations (range 35-19,547 ng/g lipid weight, lw) were similar to blubber concentrations, while alpha-HBCD levels in seal liver (range 2-279 ng/g lw) were significantly higher than levels in blubber. Tissue distribution of PBDEs and alpha-HBCD varied significantly by age and, surprisingly, by gender among the pups. Biomagnification of alpha-HBCD from fish to seal liver and blubber was negligible to low, implying that harbor seals can metabolize this persistent isomer. Similar to the patterns in blubber, tri- through hexa-BDEs were highly biomagnified from fish to seal liver. In contrast, BDE-209 concentrations in liver were up to five times higher than those in blubber, which is consistent with observations that BDE-209 migrates to perfused tissues such as the liver in biota. Although detection frequency was low, BDE-209 levels in seal liver were up to ten times higher than those in their prey fish, suggesting that the accumulation/biomagnification of Deca-BDE in marine food webs is tissue-specific. As BDE-209 is the dominant PBDE found in marine sediments, its biomagnification in marine ecosystems is of concern. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study is the first quantitative study of the shallow rocky sublittoral of the Cyclades based on in situ underwater surveys of algal cover, and fish and sea urchin abundance at 181 sampling sites in 25 islands to provide a baseline and investigate the relationship between these communities. Algal turf was the most abundant algal functional group, and canopy algae of the genus Cystoseira were more abundant at the northern islands. A range in fish biomass of almost two orders of magnitude was found across islands, but overall the Cyclades displayed much lower values than fished areas of the Western Mediterranean. We observed apex predators only in 25% of our sampling sites, and their biomass was uncorrelated to total fish biomass, indicating a depleted ecosystem. Sea urchin biomass was also low but similar to values found in other Mediterranean islands and was positively correlated with barrens. We observed a gradient of benthic community complexity from sea urchin barrens to communities dominated by Cystoseira spp. There was no correlation between sea urchins and their predators Diplodus spp., which presented extremely low densities.

Estimating the Potential Impacts of Large Mesopredators on Benthic Resources: Integrative Assessment of Spotted Eagle Ray Foraging Ecology in Bermuda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MOVEMENT PATTERNS; HABITAT USE; MYLIOBATIS-CALIFORNICA; AETOBATUS-NARINARI; RHINOPTERA-BONASUS; TOMALES BAY; SHARKS; BEHAVIOR; PREDATOR; STINGRAY	Declines of large sharks and subsequent release of elasmobranch mesopredators (smaller sharks and rays) may pose problems for marine fisheries management as some mesopredators consume exploitable shellfish species. The spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) is the most abundant inshore elasmobranch in subtropical Bermuda, but its predatory role remains unexamined despite suspected abundance increases and its hypothesized specialization for mollusks. We utilized a combination of acoustic telemetry, benthic invertebrate sampling, gut content analysis and manipulative experiments to assess the impact of spotted eagle rays on Bermudian shellfish resources. Residency and distribution of adult spotted eagle rays was monitored over two consecutive summers in Harrington Sound (HS), an enclosed inshore lagoon that has historically supported multiple recreational and commercial shellfish species. Telemetered rays exhibited variable fidelity (depending on sex) to HS, though generally selected regions that supported relatively high densities of potential mollusk prey. Gut content analysis from rays collected in HS revealed a diet of mainly bivalves and a few gastropods, with calico clam (Macrocallista maculata) representing the most important prey item. Manipulative field and mesocosm experiments with calico clams suggested that rays selected prey patches based on density, though there was no evidence of rays depleting clam patches to extirpation. Overall, spotted eagle rays had modest impacts on local shellfish populations at current population levels, suggesting a reduced role in transmitting cascading effects from apex predator loss. However, due to the strong degree of coupling between rays and multiple protected mollusks in HS, ecosystem-based management that accounts for ray predation should be adopted.

Extraordinary Aggressive Behavior from the Giant Coral Reef Fish, Bolbometopon muricatum, in a Remote Marine Reserve	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPAWNING BEHAVIOR; SOLOMON-ISLANDS; IMPACTS; KNOWLEDGE; HABITATS; SIZE	Human impacts to terrestrial and marine communities are widespread and typically begin with the local extirpation of large-bodied animals. In the marine environment, few pristine areas relatively free of human impact remain to provide baselines of ecosystem function and goals for restoration efforts. Recent comparisons of remote and/or protected coral reefs versus impacted sites suggest remote systems are dominated by apex predators, yet in these systems the ecological role of nonpredatory, large-bodied, highly vulnerable species such as the giant bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) has received less attention. Overfishing of Bolbometopon has lead to precipitous declines in population density and avoidance of humans throughout its range, contributing to its status as a candidate species under the U. S. Endangered Species Act and limiting opportunities to study unexploited populations. Here we show that extraordinary ecological processes, such as violent headbutting contests by the world's largest parrotfish, can be revealed by studying unexploited ecosystems, such as the coral reefs of Wake Atoll where we studied an abundant population of Bolbometopon. Bolbometopon is among the largest of coral reef fishes and is a well known, charismatic species, yet to our knowledge, no scientific documentation of ritualized headbutting exists for marine fishes. Our observations of aggressive headbutting by Bolbometopon underscore that remote locations and marine reserves, by inhibiting negative responses to human observers and by allowing the persistence of historical conditions, can provide valuable opportunities to study ecosystems in their natural state, thereby facilitating the discovery, conservation, and interpretation of a range of sometimes remarkable behavioral and ecological processes.

Pelagic fishing at seamounts, where hyperstability of pelagic predators may occur, can exacerbate declining abundance and have high bycatch of species groups that are highly vulnerable to overexploitation. Generalized additive mixed Poisson regression models (GAMMs) were fitted to Hawaii longline tuna fishery observer data to determine temporal trends in standardized catch rates, an index for local, relative abundance. Temporal trends in expectile length distributions were determined through geoadditive expectile GAMMs. Significant declining trends in relative abundance in this fishery were observed for tunas, sharks and billfish. A decline in seabird standardized catch rate occurred concurrently with the uptake of seabird bycatch mitigation technology. Changed spatial distribution of fishing effort and increased use of wider circle hooks likely contributed to a declining sea turtle standardized catch rate. Tuna and billfish mean lengths significantly increased over the time series due to entire distributions of length classes having shifted towards larger fish. Larger tunas comprised a larger proportion of the catch due to fewer small tunas being caught, and to a lesser extent because mean lengths of larger size classes increased. Conversely, billfish largest length classes experienced the largest increases in average lengths. Changes in spatial and seasonal distributions of fishing effort, increased use of wider circle hooks, and possibly increasing purse seine selective removals of juvenile tunas, may have contributed to increased selectivity for larger fish. Significant differences in standardized catch rates and length distributions at a shallow seamount vs. the open ocean confirms the aggregating effect of seamounts on pelagic predators, including juvenile market species of pelagic fish and species groups relatively vulnerable to overexploitation. Wider circle hooks significantly improved valuable tuna standardized catch rates, but also increased unwanted shark and reduced valuable billfish standardized catch rates.

Diet composition of batoids on the continental shelf off Nayarit and Sinaloa, Mexico	CIENCIAS MARINAS			English	Article						rays; feeding habits; guitarfish; trophic overlap	FEEDING ECOLOGY; BATHYRAJA-MACLOVIANA; ELASMOBRANCH FISHES; TROPHIC ECOLOGY; COASTAL WATERS; ISKENDERUN BAY; FOOD-HABITS; ATLANTIC; SKATE; RAY	Since elasmobranchs are frequently apex predators in marine ecosystems, information on their diet is essential for understanding trophic relationships in these systems. Trophic similarity between six batoid species (Rhinoptera steindachneri, Rhinobatos glaucostigma, Dasyatis dipterura, Urounon aspidura, U. nana, and U. rogersi) was examined by analyzing the stomach contents of 140 individuals. Specimens were caught by the commercial shrimp fishery in the central Mexican Pacific. In total, 88.6% of the stomachs were completely to partially full, allowing the identification of 77 types of prey. The primary dietary components were crustaceans, followed by annelids and mollusks. Values of diet breadth for the six species indicated low diversity in prey items. Diet similarity suggested two trophic guilds: R. glaucostigma, U. nana, and U. aspidura belong to the cancritrophic guild (P < 0.05) and U. rogersi and D. dipterura to the annelid-crustacean guild. Rhinoptera steindachneri showed no evident pattern of association (feeding primarily on ophiuroids). In light of these results, we argue that a distribution of alimentary resources (niche partitioning) between the six species favors their coexistence.	[Navarro-Gonzalez, J.

J	Daley, AC; Bergstrom, J				Daley, Allison C.; Bergstrom, Jan			The oral cone of Anomalocaris is not a classic "peytoia"	NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN			English	Article						Anomalocaridids; Cambrian; Oral cone; Peytoia; Predation; Burgess Shale	BURGESS SHALE; ARTHROPODS; EVOLUTION; FAUNA	The Cambro-Ordovician anomalocaridids are large ecdysozoans commonly regarded as ancestors of the arthropods and apex predators. Predation is indicated partly by the presence of an unusual "peytoia"-type oral cone, which is a tetraradial outer ring of 32 plates, four of which are enlarged and in perpendicular arrangement. This oral cone morphology was considered a highly consistent and defining characteristic of well-known Burgess Shale taxa. It is here shown that Anomalocaris has a different oral cone, with only three large plates and a variable number of smaller and medium plates. Its functional morphology suggests that suction, rather than biting, was used for food ingestion, and that anomalocaridids in general employed a range of different scavenging and predatory feeding strategies. Removing anomalocaridids from the position of highly specialized trilobite predators forces a reconsideration of the ecological structure of the earliest marine animal communities in the Cambrian.

Inadequate knowledge of the spatial and trophic ecology of these marine animals ultimately compromises the viability of their populations and impedes our ability to use them as environmental biomonitors. Intrinsic biogeochemical markers, such as stable isotopes, fatty acids, trace elements, and chemical pollutants, are increasingly being used to trace the spatial and trophic ecology of marine top predators. Notable advances include the emergence of the first oceanographic "isoscapes" (isotopic geographic gradients), the advent of compound-specific isotopic analyses, improvements in diet reconstruction through Bayesian statistics, and tissue analysis of tracked animals to ground-truth biogeochemical profiles. However, most researchers still focus on only a few tracers. Moreover, insufficient knowledge of the biogeochemical integration in tissues, fractionation and routing processes, and geographic and temporal variability in baseline levels continue to hamper the resolution and potential of these markers in studying the spatial and feeding ecology of top predators.

Sequential movement into coastal habitats and high spatial overlap of predator and prey suggest high predation pressure in protected areas	OIKOS			English	Article							MARINE PREDATOR; APEX PREDATOR; SHARK; ECOLOGY; RISK; FEAR; CONSERVATION; MIGRATION; DYNAMICS; DECLINES	In theory, predators should attempt to match the distribution of their prey, and prey to avoid areas of high predation risk. However, there is a scarcity of empirical knowledge on predator and prey spatial use when both are moving freely in their natural environment. In the current study, we use information collated on a predators diet, its population structure, as well as predator and prey relative abundance, and track the movements of predator and prey simultaneously to compare habitat use and evaluate predation pressure. The study was conducted in elasmobranch protected areas of coastal Tasmania, Australia. The species considered were the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus, the apex predator in the area, and five chondrichthyan prey species. Notorynchus cepedianus and its prey show similar seasonality in the use of these coastal areas: more abundant in warmer months and absent in winter. Predator and prey also showed high spatial overlap and similar habitat use patterns. These similar movement patterns of predator and prey combined with the additional ecological information (diet, population structure of predator, relative abundance of predator and prey) suggests that N. cepedianus move into coastal areas to exploit seasonally abundant prey. Also, while in protected areas, chondrichthyans are subjected to high predation pressure. Overall, results illustrate the value of simultaneously recording and integrating multiple types of information to explore predatorprey relationships and predation pressure.

Don't bite the hand that feeds: assessing ecological impacts of provisioning ecotourism on an apex marine predator	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						feeding; migration; movement; optimal foraging; residency patterns; satellite tagging; site fidelity; tiger shark; tourism	SHARKS GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; GULF-STREAM; TIGER SHARK; HOME-RANGE; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; LEMON SHARKS; NEGAPRION-BREVIROSTRIS; HAWAIIAN WATERS; UNITED-STATES; TOURISM	1. There has been considerable debate over the past decade with respect to wildlife provisioning, especially resultant behavioural changes that may impact the ecological function of an apex predator. The controversy is exemplified by the shark diving industry, where major criticisms based on inference, anecdote and opinion stem from concerns of potential behaviourally mediated ecosystem effects because of ecotourism provisioning (akachumming or feeding). 2. There is a general lack of empirical evidence to refute or support associated claims. The few studies that have investigated the behavioural impacts of shark provisioning ecotourism have generated conflicting conclusions, where the confidence in such results may suffer from a narrow spatial and temporal focus given the highly mobile nature of these predators. There is need for studies that examine the potential behavioural consequences of provisioning over ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales. 3. To advance this debate, we conducted the first satellite telemetry study and movement analysis to explicitly examine the long-range migrations and habitat utilization of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) originating in the Bahamas and Florida, two areas that differ significantly with regards to the presence/absence of provisioning ecotourism. 4. Satellite telemetry data rejected the behaviourally mediated effects of provisioning ecotourism at large spatial and temporal scales. In contrast, to the restricted activity space and movement that were hypothesized, geolocation data evidenced previously unknown long-distance migrations and habitat use for both tiger shark populations closely associated with areas of high biological productivity in the Gulf Stream and subtropical western Atlantic Ocean. We speculate that these areas are likely critically important for G. cuvier feeding forays and parturition. 5. We concluded that, in the light of potential conservation and public awareness benefits of ecotourism provisioning, this practice should not be dismissed out of hand by managers. Given the pressing need for improved understanding of the functional ecology of apex predators relative to human disturbance, empirical studies of different species sensitivities to disturbance should be used to guide best-practice ecotourism policies that maximize conservation goals.

The trophic ecology of two abundant mesopredators in south-east coastal waters of Tasmania, Australia	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							DOGFISH SQUALUS-ACANTHIAS; MARINE APEX PREDATOR; SPINY DOGFISH; FOOD-HABITS; CENTRAL CALIFORNIA; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; PREY INTERACTIONS; FEEDING STRATEGY; MUSTELUS-MANAZO; DIETARY OVERLAP	Investigating predator-prey relationships is an important component for identifying and understanding the factors that influence the structure and function of ecosystems. Mesopredators, defined as mid-level predators, have a profound effect on ecosystem structure by contributing an important link between apex predators and lower trophic levels. The diet of two elasmobranch mesopredators, Squalus acanthias and Mustelus antarcticus, was investigated in three locations in south-east Tasmania. Squalus acanthias consumed predominantly pelagic teleosts and cephalopods, while M. antarcticus predominantly consumed benthic crustaceans. As a result, there was low dietary and niche overlap between the two species. There was however evidence of intra-specific dietary variations between locations for both the species. This study has contributed to a better understanding of the top-down dynamics of the food web in coastal Tasmania, by providing important dietary information of two abundant mesopredators. In addition, the similar dietary patterns for S. acanthias and other Mustelus species over much of their global range suggest they may be consistent in their trophic roles across systems, with limited competition between these two sympatric mesopredators to be expected.

However, the adaptive behavior of fishermen, the apex predator in the ecosystem, to MPAs may upset the balance of fishing impacts across species. While ecosystem-based management (EBM) emphasizes the protection of all species in the environment, the weakest stock often dominates management attention. We use data before and after the implementation of large spatial closures in a North Pacific trawl fishery to show how closures designed for red king crab protection spurred dramatic increases in Pacific halibut bycatch due to both direct displacement effects and indirect effects from adaptations in fishermen's targeting behavior. We identify aspects of the ecological and economic context of the fishery that contributed to these surprising behaviors, noting that many multispecies fisheries are likely to share these features. Our results highlight the need either to anticipate the behavioral adaptations of fishermen across multiple species in reserve design, a form of implementation error, or to design management systems that are robust to these adaptations. Failure to do so may yield patterns of fishing effort and mortality that undermine the broader objectives of multispecies management and potentially alter ecosystems in profound ways.

An overview on the role of Hexanchiformes in marine ecosystems: biology, ecology and conservation status of a primitive order of modern sharks	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY			English	Article						apex predator; Chlamydoselachus; Heptranchias; Hexanchus; Notorynchus; shark fishery	BLUNTNOSE SIXGILL SHARKS; HEXANCHUS-GRISEUS BONNATERRE; NOTORYNCHUS-CEPEDIANUS PERON; TEMPERATE COASTAL WATERS; NORTHEAST PACIFIC-OCEAN; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; SEVENGILL SHARK; CHLAMYDOSELACHUS-ANGUINEUS; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; APEX PREDATOR	The large size, high trophic level and wide distribution of Hexanchiformes (cow and frilled sharks) should position this order as important apex predators in coastal and deep-water ecosystems. This review synthesizes available information on Hexanchiformes, including information not yet published, with the purpose of evaluating their conservation status and assessing their ecological roles in the dynamics of marine ecosystems. Comprising six species, this group has a wide global distribution, with members occurring from shallow coastal areas to depths of c. 2500 m. The limited information available on their reproductive biology suggests that they could be vulnerable to overexploitation (e.g. small litter sizes for most species and suspected long gestation periods). Most of the fishing pressure exerted on Hexanchiformes is in the form of commercial by-catch or recreational fishing. Comprehensive stock and impact assessments are unavailable for most species in most regions due to limited information on life history and catch and abundance time series. When hexanchiform species have been commercially harvested, however, they have been unable to sustain targeted fisheries for long periods. The potentially high vulnerability to intense fishing pressure warrants a conservative exploitation of this order until thorough quantitative assessments are conducted. At least some species have been shown to be significant apex predators in the systems they inhabit. Should Hexanchiformes be removed from coastal and deep-water systems, the lack of sympatric shark species that share the same resources suggests no other species would be capable of fulfilling their apex predator role in the short term. This has potential ecosystem consequences such as meso-predator release or trophic cascades. This review proposes some hypotheses on the ecology of Hexanchiformes and their role in ecosystem dynamics, highlighting the areas where critical information is required to stimulate research directions.

Biology of the Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY			English	Article						Arctic; climate change; ecology; elasmobranch; organic contaminants; parasites		Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus is a potentially important yet poorly studied cold-water species inhabiting the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Broad-scale changes in the Arctic ecosystem as a consequence of climate change have led to increased attention on trophic dynamics and the role of potential apex predators such as S. microcephalus in the structure of Arctic marine food webs. Although Nordic and Inuit populations have caught S. microcephalus for centuries, the species is of limited commercial interest among modern industrial fisheries. Here, the limited historical information available on S. microcephalus occurrence and ecology is reviewed and new catch, biological and life-history information from the Arctic and North Atlantic Ocean region is provided. Given the considerable by-catch rates in high North Atlantic Ocean latitudes it is suggested that S. microcephalus is an abundant predator that plays an important, yet unrecognized, role in Arctic marine ecosystems. Slow growth and large pup sizes, however, may make S. microcephalus vulnerable to increased fishing pressure in a warming Arctic environment.	[MacNeil, M.

Differential exposure of alpine ospreys to mercury: Melting glaciers, hydrology or deposition patterns?

In alpine watersheds, glacial meltwater is a source of Hg, which accumulated in glaciers during the 1960-1980 cooling cycle. The considerable variation observed for Hg exposure of alpine animals in proximal watersheds could result from differences among those watersheds in Hg loading from glacial meltwater. Alternatively, variation may be the result of hydrology, atmospheric Hg deposition patterns, or food web characteristics. To examine those possibilities, we measured Hg in ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), apex predators in 15 watersheds in western Canada. Mercury levels in feathers of nestlings increased with increasing modeled atmospheric deposition rates and decreased with lake size. In eggs mercury decreased with delta C-13, an indicator of food web structure, and with pH and elevation. Thus, Hg levels in chicks were strongly associated with local patterns relevant when the chicks were growing (e.g. the period post-snow melt: Hg deposition, lake size) while Hg levels in eggs were weakly associated with local patterns relevant during the snow melt (elevation, delta C-13), with the remainder of the Hg variation in eggs determined by other factors such as possible Hg accumulation by the adult elsewhere. Modeled atmospheric deposition from prevailing upwind locations including Asia, followed by runoff into small lakes, were related to Hg patterns in osprey, with little apparent role for recent melting of glaciers. Our study highlights the importance of physical patterns to the environmental chemistry of top predators. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Until recently, the only examples have been in freshwater and marine planktonic communities. In 2002 and 2008, investigators documented inverted biomass pyramids for nearly pristine coral reef ecosystems within the NW Hawaiian islands and the Line Islands, where apex predator abundance comprises up to 85% of the fish biomass. Large predator: prey biomass ratio seems to be a signature of nearly pristine coral reefs. While the mechanism responsible for the IBP for homogeneously mixed planktonic communities seems to be well understood, this mechanism is not strictly applicable to nearly pristine coral reefs where much of the prey use coral as refuge and are inaccessible to the predators. We construct a mathematical model with an explicit refuge to illustrate a new biologically plausible mechanism that can explain stable IBPs in nearly pristine coral reefs. New modeling components include a refuge of explicit size, a refuge size dependent functional response, and refuge size dependent prey growth rate. Utilizing realistic life history parameters of coral reef fishes, our model exhibits a stable inverted biomass pyramid. We prove that all fishing decreases the biomass ratio and sufficiently strong fishing transforms the inverted biomass pyramid to be bottom heavy. Finally we use our model to test the conjecture that pristine coral reefs will rebound faster from environmental shocks and find that it is not always true.

Levy flight and Brownian search patterns of a free-ranging predator reflect different prey field characteristics	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Levy walk; migration; optimal foraging; random walk; search behaviour; strategy; superdiffusion; telemetry; archival tracking	SHARKS CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; WHITE SHARKS; FORAGING MOVEMENTS; AUSTRALIAN WATERS; ANIMAL MOVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; MIGRATION; PACIFIC; OCEAN; POPULATION	1. Search processes play an important role in physical, chemical and biological systems. In animal foraging, the search strategy predators should use to search optimally for prey is an enduring question. Some models demonstrate that when prey is sparsely distributed, an optimal search pattern is a specialised random walk known as a Levy flight, whereas when prey is abundant, simple Brownian motion is sufficiently efficient. These predictions form part of what has been termed the Levy flight foraging hypothesis (LFF) which states that as Levy flights optimise random searches, movements approximated by optimal Levy flights may have naturally evolved in organisms to enhance encounters with targets (e.g. prey) when knowledge of their locations is incomplete. 2. Whether free-ranging predators exhibit the movement patterns predicted in the LFF hypothesis in response to known prey types and distributions, however, has not been determined. We tested this using vertical and horizontal movement data from electronic tagging of an apex predator, the great white shark Carcharodon carcharias, across widely differing habitats reflecting different prey types. 3. Individual white sharks exhibited movement patterns that predicted well the prey types expected under the LFF hypothesis. Shark movements were best approximated by Brownian motion when hunting near abundant, predictable sources of prey (e.g. seal colonies, fish aggregations), whereas movements approximating truncated Levy flights were present when searching for sparsely distributed or potentially difficult-to-detect prey in oceanic or shelf environments, respectively. 4. That movement patterns approximated by truncated Levy flights and Brownian behaviour were present in the predicted prey fields indicates search strategies adopted by white sharks appear to be the most efficient ones for encountering prey in the habitats where such patterns are observed. This suggests that C. carcharias appears capable of exhibiting search patterns that are approximated as optimal in response to encountered changes in prey type and abundance, and across diverse marine habitats, from the surf zone to the deep ocean. 5. Our results provide some support for the LFF hypothesis. However, it is possible that the observed Levy patterns of white sharks may not arise from an adaptive behaviour but could be an emergent property arising from simple, straight-line movements between complex (e.g. fractal) distributions of prey. Experimental studies are needed in vertebrates to test for the presence of Levy behaviour patterns in the absence of complex prey distributions.

Millions of birds from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are largely covered by 1.8 m of ice for 10 months annually. In summer, these lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5-10A degrees C, S = 10-25) compared to more open coastal waters (0-5A degrees C, S > 27). The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e., benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based upon delta C-13 and delta N-15 values (-25.6aEuro degrees to -27.4aEuro degrees and 1.4aEuro degrees to 3.3aEuro degrees, respectively). By comparison, shifts toward more heavy isotope-enriched organic materials reflecting marine influence are observed on the adjacent coastal shelf (-24.8aEuro degrees to -25.4aEuro degrees and 3.4aEuro degrees to 5.3aEuro degrees, respectively). The isotopic composition of lagoon fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of carbon. Biomagnification of N-15 in benthic organisms indicate that the benthic food web in lagoons support up to four trophic levels, with carnivorous gastropod predators and benthic fishes (delta N-15 values up to 14.4aEuro degrees) at the apex.

Environmental Factors Affecting Large-Bodied Coral Reef Fish Assemblages in the Mariana Archipelago	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BOOSTED REGRESSION TREES; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; REMOTE HAWAIIAN ATOLLS; NORTHERN LINE ISLANDS; LIFE-HISTORY; MARSHALL-ISLANDS; FLORIDA-KEYS; CARCHARHINUS-AMBLYRHYNCHOS; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS	Large-bodied reef fishes represent an economically and ecologically important segment of the coral reef fish assemblage. Many of these individuals supply the bulk of the reproductive output for their population and have a disproportionate effect on their environment (e.g. as apex predators or bioeroding herbivores). Large-bodied reef fishes also tend to be at greatest risk of overfishing, and their loss can result in a myriad of either cascading (direct) or indirect trophic and other effects. While many studies have investigated habitat characteristics affecting populations of small-bodied reef fishes, few have explored the relationship between large-bodied species and their environment. Here, we describe the distribution of the large-bodied reef fishes in the Mariana Archipelago with an emphasis on the environmental factors associated with their distribution. Of the factors considered in this study, a negative association with human population density showed the highest relative influence on the distribution of large-bodied reef fishes; however, depth, water temperature, and distance to deep water also were important. These findings provide new information on the ecology of large-bodied reef fishes can inform discussions concerning essential fish habitat and ecosystem-based management for these species and highlight important knowledge gaps worthy of additional research.

Using Stable Isotope Analysis to Understand the Migration and Trophic Ecology of Northeastern Pacific White Sharks (Carcharodon carcharias)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TUNA THUNNUS-OBESUS; NORTH PACIFIC; EASTERN PACIFIC; CARBON ISOTOPES; LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS; COLLAGEN-SYNTHESIS; NITROGEN ISOTOPES; GUADALUPE ISLAND; HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS; DIVING BEHAVIOR	The white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is a wide-ranging apex predator in the northeastern Pacific (NEP). Electronic tagging has demonstrated that white sharks exhibit a regular migratory pattern, occurring at coastal sites during the late summer, autumn and early winter and moving offshore to oceanic habitats during the remainder of the year, although the purpose of these migrations remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to use stable isotope analysis (SIA) to provide insight into the trophic ecology and migratory behaviors of white sharks in the NEP. Between 2006 and 2009, 53 white sharks were biopsied in central California to obtain dermal and muscle tissues, which were analyzed for stable isotope values of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15). We developed a mixing model that directly incorporates movement data and tissue incorporation (turnover) rates to better estimate the relative importance of different focal areas to white shark diet and elucidate their migratory behavior. Mixing model results for muscle showed a relatively equal dietary contribution from coastal and offshore regions, indicating that white sharks forage in both areas. However, model results indicated that sharks foraged at a higher relative rate in coastal habitats. There was a negative relationship between shark length and muscle delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, which may indicate ontogenetic changes in habitat use related to onset of maturity. The isotopic composition of dermal tissue was consistent with a more rapid incorporation rate than muscle and may represent more recent foraging. Low offshore consumption rates suggest that it is unlikely that foraging is the primary purpose of the offshore migrations. These results demonstrate how SIA can provide insight into the trophic ecology and migratory behavior of marine predators, especially when coupled with electronic tagging data.

Adding ecological variables and trophic relationships into the climate equation is challenging since there are few clear connections. The present study is an exploratory data analysis to explain dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) encounter rate patterns in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand. During 20012006, dolphin encounter rate in winter decreased from 6 to 0.8 groups/h and the proportion of dolphin groups observed feeding decreased from 80% to 38% in Inner Admiralty Bay. These trends generally corresponded to cooler and moderate El Nino Southern Oscillation years, lower sea surface height, southwesterly winds, increased surface mixing and decreased sea surface salinity. To fully grasp the significance of these relationships and potential impact(s) on dolphin population trends, directed long-term studies that synthesise dolphin, prey, water quality, anthropogenic pressures and climatic information into regional climate-ecosystem models are needed.

Since 1997, the Shark Bay Ecosystem Research Project has used the relatively pristine seagrass community of Shark Bay, Australia, to investigate the potential for tiger sharks, the apex predator in the ecosystem, to have an impact on their large-bodied prey through non-consumptive ('risk') effects. Here, we synthesise nearly 15 years of data to demonstrate that tiger sharks have widespread risk effects on both large-bodied herbivores and mesopredators in Shark Bay and explore the possibility that these impacts may cascade to lower trophic levels. Although much work remains to be done, our studies suggest that losses of top predators in subtropical estuaries may have greater consequences than generally appreciated and that efforts to conserve and restore their populations should be a priority. Furthermore, future management strategies and studies must explicitly consider the potential for predators to influence behaviour of even large-bodied marine taxa.	[Heithaus, Michael.

Having been in existence for over 400 million years and representing the earliest stages of the evolution of jawed vertebrates, this group also covers a diverse range of eco-morphotypes, occupying both marine and freshwater habitats. The class Chondrichthyes is divided into two subclasses: the Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates, and rays) and the Holocephali (elephant sharks and chimaeras). However, many of their life history traits, such as low fecundity, the production of small numbers of highly precocious young, slow growth rates, and late maturity, make them highly susceptible to human exploitation. To mitigate the negative effects of human impacts, it is important that we understand the sensory strategies that elasmobranchs use for navigating within their environment, forming reproductive aggregations, feeding, and even communicating. One approach to investigate the sensory bases of their behavior is to examine the peripheral sense organs mediating vision, olfaction, gustation, lateral line, electroreception, and audition in a large range of species in order to identify specific adaptations, the range of sensitivity thresholds, and the compromise between sensory spatial resolution and sensitivity. In addition, we can quantitatively assess the convergence of sensory input to the central nervous system and the relative importance of different sensory modalities. Using a comparative approach and often a combination of anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular techniques, significant variation has been identified in the spatial and chromatic sampling of the photoreceptors in the eye, the surface area and the number of olfactory lamellae within the nasal cavity, the level of gustatory sampling within the oral cavity, the type and innervation of neuromasts of the lateral line system, the distribution of electroreceptive pores over the head, and the morphology of the inner ear. These results are presented in the context of predictions of sensory capabilities for species living in a range of ecological niches, what further research is needed, and how this sensory input may be a predictor of behavior.

Ctenacanthiform sharks from the Permian Kaibab Formation, northern Arizona	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Kaibab Formation; ctenacanthiform sharks; Arizona; Permian	FEEDING MECHANISMS; CHONDRICHTHYES; CLADODUS; ELASMOBRANCHII; BRAINCASE; TEETH; FAUNA	A diverse assemblage of chondrichthyans has recently been recognised from the Permian (Late Leonardian) Kaibab Formation in and around Flagstaff, Arizona. Of this diverse assemblage, the ctenacanthiforms constitute seven tooth taxa of which three are new: Saivodus sp., Neosaivodus flagstaffensis gen. et sp. nov., Glikmanius occidentalis, Glikmanius myachkovensis, Heslerodus divergens, Kaibabvenator swiftae gen. et sp. nov. and Nanoskalme natans gen. et sp. nov. The range in tooth types suggests predator partitioning within these ctenacanths. Saivodus sp., Neosaivodus flagstaffensis gen. et sp. nov., H. divergens, G. occidentalis and G. myachkovensis had puncturing and grasping teeth adapted for securing smaller prey to be swallowed whole. Nanoskalme natans gen. et sp. nov. had teeth for grasping and cutting, perhaps an adaption for feeding or scavenging on larger organisms, whereas K. swiftae gen. et sp. nov. had large grasping and serrated cutting teeth for feeding on larger prey and was perhaps the apex predator of the Kaibab Sea. A cladistic analysis of the Ctenacanthiformes based on teeth suggests that in contrast to previous interpretations the family Ctenacanthidae may in fact be paraphyletic. We propose that the Ctenacanthiformes had a greater familiar diversity than currently recognised. The Kaibab assemblage is presently the most diverse ctenacanth assemblage for the global marine Permian.

Marine mammal response to interannual variability in Monterey Bay, California	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Upwelling; El Nino; Density; Diversity; California Current; Distance sampling	COASTAL UPWELLING SYSTEM; SQUID LOLIGO-OPALESCENS; 1992 EL-NINO; NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; COPEPOD BIODIVERSITY; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; CURRENT ECOSYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE	The coastal upwelling ecosystem near Monterey Bay, California, is a productive yet variable ecosystem and an important foraging area for many mobile apex predators, such as marine mammals. Long-term studies are necessary to better understand how wide-ranging predators respond to temporal environmental variability; however, few of these studies exist. We conducted monthly shipboard line-transect surveys in Monterey Bay from 1997 to 2007. We identified 22 species of marine mammals, and calculated monthly and annual densities for the 12 most commonly sighted (focal) species. Species richness remained relatively constant (mean richness +/- SE: 13.7 +/- 0.396 species yr(-1)) from 1997 to 2006. Focal species were most evenly distributed (Shannon's equitability, E-H = 0.820) but least dense (mean density +/- SE: 0.0598 +/- 0.0141) during the anomalous upwelling conditions of 2005, and least even (1997 E-H = 0.413; 1998 E-H = 0.407) but dense (mean density +/- SE: 1997: 0.433 +/- 0.177; 1998: 0.438 +/- 0.169 ind. km(-2)) during the 1997/1998 El Nino event. There were no statistically significant differences in the densities of marine mammal species between warmer and cooler years. The community and species-specific responses of marine mammals to warm-water years differed depending on the mechanism of oceanographic variability. During the 1997/1998 El Nino (a basin-wide event), marine mammals aggregated in nearshore areas, such as Monterey Bay, with relatively greater productivity than offshore regions, whereas during anomalous upwelling conditions of 2005 (a more localized oceanographic event), marine mammals redistributed away from Monterey Bay to areas less affected by the anomaly.

The ecosystem is notoriously poor in subaquatic vegetation, the main components of manatees' diet. Due to the constant presence of manatees in the bay and their ability to consume large volumes of plant material, it is assumed that the species has a relevant trophic impact on the system. A mass-balance trophic model was designed to describe the flows of energy and matter in the bay, with the goal of assessing the role of manatees in the system. The system was aggregated in eight effective trophic levels. The biomass was intensely concentrated in the detritus, suggesting that the matter on the bottom sediment is the main regulator of the energy flow in the system. Primary producers comprised of detritus, mangrove, benthic autotrophs, and phytoplankton. The apex predators were dolphins and large piscivorous fishes. Manatees occupied the trophic level 2.0. Manatees were directly or indirectly impacted by autotrophs, mangrove, and detritus; but the competition between manatees and other groups was insignificant. In comparison to other ecosystems where manatees occur, Chetumal Bay (BCh) has the lowest relative biomass of seagrasses. Several ecological and behavioral mechanisms to compensate the lack of macrophytes biomass (or a combination of several) are suggested. Ecopath with Ecosim models are useful to describe the flow of energy and matter in the ecosystems. However, there are still critical gaps in the knowledge of BCh and its manatee population. It is difficult to assess the uncertainty associated with the estimates obtained; therefore, results should be interpreted with caution. Improving this preliminary model with robust local information on the Chetumal Bay ecology and its manatee population is recommended.

Marine species invasions in estuaries and harbors	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Marine invasions; Human introductions; Biodiversity; Trophic levels; Transplantation; Conservation	COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS; BIODIVERSITY; OCEAN; INTRODUCTIONS; COMMUNITIES; MECHANISMS; CALIFORNIA; DIVERSITY; SERVICES; FISH	The biodiversity of most marine communities is more or less dependent on continuous invasions from sources with greater richness. These ongoing, natural invasions have become greatly augmented by ship traffic in numerous estuaries and harbors where the native biota has been diminished or lost due to habitat destruction and pollution. Some of the invaders proved to be pests, indicating that these kinds of human introductions need to be controlled, but the ultimate management problem is that the invaders have generally increased diversity at the lower trophic levels after the top-level predators were lost or diminished. During the past 20 yr, work on habitat improvement has been progressing within many estuaries. But so far there is little evidence of the final step in restoration, which should be the revival of a balanced, more productive ecosystem. The inflow of invasions can be lessened by the prevention of ballast water release, pollution control, and habitat improvement. These changes should be followed by steps to reintroduce apex-level predators in order to restore natural ecosystems.

Sampling of parental deliveries to murre chicks was carried out during the breeding season on Funk Island, located off northeast Newfoundland, Canada. Concurrent vessel surveys were conducted throughout the murre's diving and foraging range around the colony to characterize the prey field. Results indicated that in years when capelin was abundant in the size range consumed by murres (suitable capelin), murres delivered large and small fish in similar proportions, whereas they delivered more large fish when suitable capelin abundance was low. Considering the relative abundances of small and large suitable capelin, these observations suggest negative prey switching by the predator. Using foraging theory, we derived a model which estimates the probability of delivering a specific prey type (large or small capelin or other prey) to the chick based on prey availabilities. This quantitative model was capable of reproducing the general patterns in the observations. It also allowed estimating the shape of the common murre's multispecies functional response (MSFR) which indicated that this would conform to the definition of prey switching, and could then be classified as a Type 3. From an applied perspective, our results support the use of predator diets as indicators of their food base, but also highlight the need for understanding the shape of the predator's MSFR for quantitative development of these types of applications.

Evaluating the demographic buffering hypothesis with vital rates estimated for Weddell seals from 30 years of mark-recapture data	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						demography; environmental canalization; Leptonychotes weddellii; marine mammal; pinniped; population dynamics	POPULATION-GROWTH RATE; SOUTHERN ELEPHANT SEALS; AGE-SPECIFIC SURVIVAL; ANTARCTIC FUR SEALS; LONG-LIVED SEABIRD; LIFE-HISTORIES; TEMPORAL VARIATION; ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MCMURDO-SOUND	1. Life-history theory predicts that those vital rates that make larger contributions to population growth rate ought to be more strongly buffered against environmental variability than are those that are less important. Despite the importance of the theory for predicting demographic responses to changes in the environment, it is not yet known how pervasive demographic buffering is in animal populations because the validity of most existing studies has been called into question because of methodological deficiencies. 2. We tested for demographic buffering in the southern-most breeding mammal population in the world using data collected from 5558 known-age female Weddell seals over 30 years. We first estimated all vital rates simultaneously with mark-recapture analysis and then estimated process variance and covariance in those rates using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We next calculated the population growth rate's sensitivity to changes in each of the vital rates and tested for evidence of demographic buffering by comparing properly scaled values of sensitivity and process variance in vital rates. 3. We found evidence of positive process covariance between vital rates, which indicates that all vital rates are affected in the same direction by changes in annual environment. Despite the positive correlations, we found strong evidence that demographic buffering occurred through reductions in variation in the vital rates to which population growth rate was most sensitive. Process variation in vital rates was inversely related to sensitivity measures such that variation was greatest in breeding probabilities, intermediate for survival rates of young animals and lowest for survival rates of older animals. 4. Our work contributes to a small but growing set of studies that have used rigorous methods on long-term, detailed data to investigate demographic responses to environmental variation. The information from these studies improves our understanding of life-history evolution in stochastic environments and provides useful information for predicting population responses to future environmental change. Our results for an Antarctic apex predator also provide useful baselines from a marine ecosystem when its top-and middle-trophic levels were not substantially impacted by human activity.

Contrasting C and N isotope ratios from sperm whale skin and squid between the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of California: effect of habitat	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							STABLE-ISOTOPES; JUMBO SQUID; LIPID EXTRACTION; TROPHIC POSITION; NORTH PACIFIC; NITROGEN; CARBON; BEHAVIOR; MARINE; DIET	To investigate feeding variation between populations of an apex oceanic predator, stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-13) have been compared in skin of female and immature male sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) from the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and the Gulf of California (GC). Whale sexes were determined genetically. The delta C-13 and delta C-13 values from squid muscle were used from the GC, and from inshore and offshore sites in the GoM. We documented contrastingly lower delta C-13 and delta N-13 from whales and squid of the GoM compared with those from the GC. While this difference may be associated with variation in trophic position, geographic variation in biochemical cycling influenced significantly the contrasting isotope values between gulfs.

In only a few, though well-documented cases, however, has this been considered in the marine environment. Herein, we review studies that have quantified behavioral responses of Ad,lie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae and emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri to the direct presence of predators, and question why the penguins avoid entering or exiting the water at night. We also show, through literature review and new analyses of Ad,lie penguin diving data, that Antarctic penguins are capable of successful prey capture in the dark (defined here as < 3.4 lux). Finally, we summarize extensive data on seasonal migration relative to darkness and prey availability. On the basis of our findings, we propose that penguins' avoidance of foraging at night is due to fear of predation, and not to an inability to operate effectively in darkness. We further propose that, at polar latitudes where darkness is more a seasonal than a year-round, daily feature, this "risk aversion" affects migratory movements in both species, consistent with the "trade-off" hypothesis seen in other marine vertebrates weighing foraging success against predation risk in their choice of foraging habitat. Such non-consumptive, behavioral aspects of species interactions have yet to be considered as important in Southern Ocean food webs, but may help to explain enigmatic movement patterns and choice of foraging grounds in these penguin species.

Body size estimation and evolution in metriorhynchid crocodylomorphs: implications for species diversification and niche partitioning	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						biodiversity; Metriorhynchidae; phenotypic evolution; Thalattosuchia	COPES RULE; SALT-GLANDS; ALLIGATOR-MISSISSIPPIENSIS; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; CROCODILE METRIORHYNCHUS; GEOSAURUS-ARAUCANENSIS; PHENOTYPIC EVOLUTION; RANDOM-WALKS; THALATTOSUCHIA; CROCODYLIFORMES	Metriorhynchids were a peculiar group of fully marine Mesozoic crocodylomorphs, some of which reached large body size and were probably apex predators. The estimation of their total body length in the past has proven problematic. Rigorous size estimation was provided using five complete metriorhynchid specimens, by means of regression equations derived from basicranial and femoral length against total body length. The use of the Alligator femoral regression equation as a proxy to estimate metriorhynchid total body length led to a slight underestimation, whereas cranial regression equations of extant genera resulted in an overestimation of body length. Therefore, the scaling of crania and femora to total body length of metriorhynchids is noticeably different from that of extant crocodylians, indicating that extant crocodylians are not ideal proxies for size reconstruction of extinct taxa that deviate from their semi-aquatic morphotype. The lack of a correlation between maximum, minimum, or the range of generic body lengths with species richness demonstrates that species diversification is driven by factors other than just variation in body size. Maximum likelihood modelling also found no evidence for directionality in body size evolution. However, niche partitioning in Metriorhynchidae is mediated not only by craniodental differentiation, as shown by previous studies, but also by body size variation.

Reducing uncertainty on the Grand Bank: tracking and vessel surveys indicate mortality risks for common murres in the North-West Atlantic	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						common murre; at-sea distribution; anthropogenic risk; offshore oil pollution; fisheries bycatch; murre harvest; year-round tracking	OIL POLLUTION; MARINE BIRDS; GILLNET FISHERIES; INCIDENTAL CATCH; FLYING SEABIRDS; OFFSHORE OIL; NEWFOUNDLAND; SEA; MIGRATION; CONSERVATION	Seabirds and other marine animals are at risk from anthropogenic activities that target them directly and those that can harm them incidentally. We integrate year-round tracking and vessel studies to assess risks for a globally important seabird population in the North-West Atlantic. The eastern Canadian Grand Bank has a rich and diverse food web that supports an abundance of apex predators. Major resource extraction industries (hydrocarbon production and fisheries) operate in the area, and, in addition to shipping and hunting, pose risks for marine birds. Understanding the relative risks has been hampered by poor information on bird distribution at sea. Here, we deployed global location sensors (loggers or geolocators) on common murres Uria aalge at Funk Island, the species' largest North American breeding colony. Adults (n=10) were resident on the Grand Bank and in adjacent pelagic waters year round. Within 10 days of leaving the colony, males dispersed offshore (<50 degrees W), southsouth-east of Funk Island. Females departed later and spent 10-47 days in coastal waters before moving offshore. All birds were in the vicinity of offshore oil platforms during November and December, but remained outside the area of the coastal Newfoundland and Labrador murre hunt. Three of six tracked females, but only one of four tracked males moved closer to shore during January and February where vulnerability to the hunt may have increased. Vessel-based surveys confirmed the importance of offshore, shelf-edge habitats for murres in winter. Our results highlight the relative risk to wintering murres from different human activities, providing a sound scientific rationale for focusing conservation and management actions. This information is particularly timely given the continued expansion of deep-water drilling in the North-West Atlantic and increasing risk of oil pollution for seabirds attracted to platforms.

Behavioural evidence for colour vision in an elasmobranch	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						colour vision; colour discrimination; giant shovelnose ray; Glaucostegus typus	CORAL-REEF FISH; VISUAL PIGMENTS; SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY; SHARKS; RETINA; LIGHT; DISCRIMINATION; TRANSMISSION; UNDERWATER	Little is known about the sensory abilities of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) compared with other fishes. Despite their role as apex predators in most marine and some freshwater habitats, interspecific variations in visual function are especially poorly studied. Of particular interest is whether they possess colour vision and, if so, the role(s) that colour may play in elasmobranch visual ecology. The recent discovery of three spectrally distinct cone types in three different species of ray suggests that at least some elasmobranchs have the potential for functional trichromatic colour vision. However, in order to confirm that these species possess colour vision, behavioural experiments are required. Here, we present evidence for the presence of colour vision in the giant shovelnose ray (Glaucostegus typus) through the use of a series of behavioural experiments based on visual discrimination tasks. Our results show that these rays are capable of discriminating coloured reward stimuli from other coloured (unrewarded) distracter stimuli of variable brightness with a success rate significantly different from chance. This study represents the first behavioural evidence for colour vision in any elasmobranch, using a paradigm that incorporates extensive controls for relative stimulus brightness. The ability to discriminate colours may have a strong selective advantage for animals living in an aquatic ecosystem, such as rays, as a means of filtering out surface-wave-induced flicker.

Use of sensitivity and comparative analyses in constructing plausible trophic mass-balance models of a data-limited marine ecosystem - The KwaZulu-Natal Bight, South Africa	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Ecosystem models; KwaZulu-Natal Bight; South Africa; Agulhas current; Benguela; Data-poor environments	PROTECTIVE GILL NETS; DOLPHINS DELPHINUS-DELPHIS; SHARKS CAUGHT; EAST-COAST; AGULHAS ECOSYSTEM; NETWORK ANALYSIS; FOOD-WEB; AGE; PISCES; GROWTH	Ecosystem modelling allows for an understanding of the structure and functioning of data-limited ecosystems provided that models undergo extensive sensitivity analyses to explore the levels of uncertainty. We explored one such data-limited system, the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight, a river-influenced bight on the east coast of South Africa. Potential system states of the KZN Bight were created by constructing multiple models in Ecopath with Ecosim, carrying out sensitivity analyses and comparing outputs. Sensitivity analyses showed that models were most sensitive to apex predator parameters and a comparison of outputs showed the important influence of riverine detritus on system functioning. To demonstrate the KZN Bight models could reproduce known differences to other ecosystems a comparison of the nutrient-poor KZN Bight to the nutrient-rich Southern Benguela was carried out. This confirmed that the KZN Bight was considerably smaller in biomass, productivity and fishery landings than the Southern Benguela with the systems being detritus-driven and phytoplankton-driven respectively. The KZN Bight relied on large detritus imports from rivers and had higher cycling through the system. The reliance on detritus import from rivers has riverine and fishery management implications as a decrease in riverine detritus caused a decrease in biomass of biotic groups, including targeted fishery species.

We have used an Ecopath-with-Ecosim model to predict the impacts of lionfish invasion on a coral reef community based on pre-invasion fish community data. Forty-six groups were defined, and an initial Ecopath model was balanced with a near-zero biomass of lionfish. In Ecosim, the near-zero biomass was eradicated by applying a very high fishing pressure in the first year of simulation. We subsequently (re-)introduced lionfish with a very low biomass, and allowed them to increase to very high abundance. With a near-zero lionfish biomass, the great majority of mesocarnivorous/omnivorous coral reef fish were predicted to be dominant while sharks were predicted to be the apex predators. Different management scenarios were established in the ecosystem to explore the eradication and resilience of lionfish. The management scenarios showed that if all adult lionfish were exploitable it will in theory be possible to fish the lionfish to a very low level, but the fishing pressure will have to be maintained, or the lionfish will recover. If the largest individuals are unexploitable it will be much more difficult to control the lionfish population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Spatial ecology and residency patterns of adult great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) in coastal waters of The Bahamas	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							REMOTE HAWAIIAN ATOLLS; MARINE RESERVE DESIGN; NEGAPRION-BREVIROSTRIS; ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; FLORIDA ESTUARY; SITE FIDELITY; ALBULA-VULPES; SHARKS; FISHES	Great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) were implanted with acoustic telemetry transmitters (n = 42) and monitored within a stationary acoustic receiver array (n = 53 receivers) in The Bahamas to examine residency, seasonal movements, and habitat use. Barracuda were monitored for up to 980 days and remained within the array area similar to 33% (median value) of the time. Most tagged barracuda were transient and would often disappear from the array for months at a time, particularly in the summer where they were usually last detected on receivers located in deeper shelf habitats, and then return at other times in the year. Habitat use across the footprint of the array differed, with most detections occurring in coastal areas and comparatively fewer in deeper mosaic or shelf habitats. Linear home range estimates revealed that some barracuda moved > 12 km within a single day and are capable of migrating > 100 km to other islands in the Bahamian Archipelago. Our results provide some of the first telemetry data for this apex marine predatory fish and the Wrst reliable information on the residency and localized seasonal movements of adult great barracuda in the coastal waters of the Western Atlantic.

Creation of a Gilded Trap by the High Economic Value of the Maine Lobster Fishery	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						common pool resources; domesticated ecosystems; ecosystem dynamics; fisheries; gilded trap; resilience; social traps	KELP FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; HOMARUS-AMERICANUS; SHELL DISEASE; RESILIENCE; CONNECTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; COLLAPSE; IMPACTS	Unsustainable fishing simplifies food chains and, as with aquaculture, can result in reliance on a few economically valuable species. This lack of diversity may increase risks of ecological and economic disruptions. Centuries of intense fishing have extirpated most apex predators in the Gulf of Maine (United States and Canada), effectively creating an American lobster (Homarus americanus) monoculture. Over the past 20 years, the economic diversity of marine resources harvested in Maine has declined by almost 70%. Today, over 80% of the value of Maine's fish and seafood landings is from highly abundant lobsters. Inflation-corrected income from lobsters in Maine has steadily increased by nearly 400% since 1985. Fisheries managers, policy makers, and fishers view this as a success. However, such lucrative monocultures increase the social and ecological consequences of future declines in lobsters. In southern New England, disease and stresses related to increases in ocean temperature resulted in more than a 70% decline in lobster abundance, prompting managers to propose closing that fishery. A similar collapse in Maine could fundamentally disrupt the social and economic foundation of its coast. We suggest the current success of Maine's lobster fishery is a gilded trap. Gilded traps are a type of social trap in which collective actions resulting from economically attractive opportunities outweigh concerns over associated social and ecological risks or consequences. Large financial gain creates a strong reinforcing feedback that deepens the trap. Avoiding or escaping gilded traps requires managing for increased biological and economic diversity. This is difficult to do prior to a crisis while financial incentives for maintaining the status quo are large. The long-term challenge is to shift fisheries management away from single species toward integrated social-ecological approaches that diversify local ecosystems, societies, and economies.

The importance of marine vs. human-induced subsidies in the maintenance of an expanding mesocarnivore in the arctic tundra	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						allochthonous spillover; arctic fox; lemming; population cycles; red fox; reindeer; stable isotopes; vole	STABLE-CARBON ISOTOPES; FOX ALOPEX-LAGOPUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; VULPES-VULPES; FOOD WEBS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; RODENT DYNAMICS; NATIONAL-PARK; SMALL MAMMALS	1. Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators. However, in the case of the northward expansion of the red fox into the arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved. 2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use by red foxes across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient, Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis. 3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle. Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric voles. Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast. 4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in reindeer management through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome.

Trophic Downgrading of Planet Earth	SCIENCE			English	Review							YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; SEA OTTERS; INTRODUCED PREDATORS; ALEUTIAN ARCHIPELAGO; TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS; GROUND IMPACTS; FOOD WEBS; TOP-DOWN; COMMUNITY; DYNAMICS	Until recently, large apex consumers were ubiquitous across the globe and had been for millions of years. The loss of these animals may be humankind's most pervasive influence on nature. Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.

Tracking apex marine predator movements in a dynamic ocean	NATURE			English	Article							PACIFIC-OCEAN; BLUEFIN TUNA; MORTALITY; HABITAT; SHARKS; FISH; POPULATION; RESOURCES; MIGRATION; TURTLES	Pelagic marine predators face unprecedented challenges and uncertain futures. Overexploitation and climate variability impact the abundance and distribution of top predators in ocean ecosystems(1-4). Improved understanding of ecological patterns, evolutionary constraints and ecosystem function is critical for preventing extinctions, loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystem services. Recent advances in electronic tagging techniques have provided the capacity to observe the movements and long-distance migrations of animals in relation to ocean processes across a range of ecological scales(5,6). Tagging of Pacific Predators, a field programme of the Census of Marine Life, deployed 4,306 tags on 23 species in the North Pacific Ocean, resulting in a tracking data set of unprecedented scale and species diversity that covers 265,386 tracking days from 2000 to 2009. Here we report migration pathways, link ocean features to multispecies hotspots and illustrate niche partitioning within and among congener guilds. Our results indicate that the California Current large marine ecosystem and the North Pacific transition zone attract and retain a diverse assemblage of marine vertebrates. Within the California Current large marine ecosystem, several predator guilds seasonally undertake north-south migrations that may be driven by oceanic processes, species-specific thermal tolerances and shifts in prey distributions. We identify critical habitats across multinational boundaries and show that top predators exploit their environment in predictable ways, providing the foundation for spatial management of large marine ecosystems.

Despite their ecological importance, however, the Early Jurassic species represent a reduced remnant of their former significance in the Triassic. Ichthyosaurs passed through an evolutionary bottleneck at, or close to, the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, which reduced their diversity to as few as three or four lineages. Diversity bounced back to some extent in the aftermath of the end-Triassic mass extinction, but disparity remained at less than one-tenth of pre-extinction levels, and never recovered. The group remained at low diversity and disparity for its final 100 Myr. The end-Triassic mass extinction had a previously unsuspected profound effect in resetting the evolution of apex marine predators of the Mesozoic.

POP concentrations measured in a dolphin's blubber are influenced by a number of factors, including the animal's sex and ranging pattern in relation to POP point sources. This study examined POP concentrations measured in bottlenose dolphin blubber samples (n = 102) from the Georgia. USA coast in relation to individual ranging patterns and specifically, distance of sightings from a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) point source near Brunswick, Georgia. Dolphin ranging patterns were determined based upon 5 years of photo-identification data from two field sites approximately 40 km apart: (1) the Brunswick field site, which included the Turtle/Brunswick River Estuary (TBRE), and (2) the Sapelo field site, which included the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve (SINERR). Dolphins were categorized into one of three ranging patterns from photo-identification data. Individuals with sighting histories exclusively within one of the defined field sites were considered to have either Brunswick or Sapelo ranging patterns. Individuals sighted in both field sites were classified as having a Mixed ranging pattern. Brunswick males had the highest concentrations of PCBs reported for any marine mammal. The pattern of PCB congeners was consistent with Aroclor 1268, a highly chlorinated PCB mixture associated with a Superfund site in Brunswick. PCB levels in Sapelo males were lower than in Brunswick males, but comparable to the highest levels measured in other dolphin populations along the southeastern U.S. Female dolphins had higher Aroclor 1268 proportions than males, suggesting that the highly chlorinated congeners associated with Aroclor 1268 may not be offloaded through parturition and lactation, as easily as less halogenated POPs. Individuals sighted farther from the Superfund point source had lower Aroclor 1268 proportions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Balmer, Brian C.; McLellan, William A.; Pabst, D.

The movement patterns of broadnose sevengill sharks, Notorynchus cepedianus, were monitored with acoustic and satellite technology in coastal areas of southeast Tasmania, Australia. Individuals were tagged in two habitats (Norfolk Bay and the Derwent Estuary) for which we had ecological information such as diet, population structure and abundance. Notorynchus cepedianus showed seasonal site fidelity in the use of the coastal habitats. The general pattern was for sharks to exit coastal areas over winter and females to return the following spring and males in summer. Their movement into these coastal areas coincided with high seasonal abundance of their known prey species during summer, suggesting feeding site fidelity. Individuals tagged in two coastal areas showed low spatial and dietary overlap, suggesting localized site fidelity and fine spatial scale resource partitioning. This has rarely been reported for large mobile predators. Both satellite and acoustic methods showed that males make northerly migrations during winter to distances of at least 1000 km. The combined use of tracking, diet and abundance information demonstrated that N. cepedianus are likely to exert significant predation pressure on prey inhabiting these areas during summer. Overall, this study highlights the benefit of complementing movement data with other ecological information to understand the habitat use of large mobile predators and their potential influences on ecosystem structure and function.

INSIGHTS USING A MOLECULAR APPROACH INTO THE LIFE CYCLE OF A TAPEWORM INFECTING GREAT WHITE SHARKS	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY			English	Article							CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; HOST-SPECIFICITY; SOUTH-AFRICA; ACANTHOBOTHRIUM-BREVISSIME; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; CESTODA; TETRAPHYLLIDEA; PLATYHELMINTHES; IDENTIFICATION; LARVAE	The great white shark Carcharodon carcharias Linnaeus, 1758 is a versatile and fierce predator (and responsible for many shark attacks on humans). This apex predator feeds on a wide range of organisms including teleosts, other elasmobranchs, cephalopods, pinnipeds, and cetaceans. Although much is known about its diet, no trophic links have been empirically identified as being involved in the transmission of its tapeworm parasites. Recently, the use of molecular tools combined with phylogenetics has proven useful to identify larval and immature stages of marine tapeworms; utilization of the technique has been increasing rapidly. However, the usefulness of this approach remains limited by the availability of molecular data. Here, I employed gene sequence data from the D2 region of the large subunit of ribosomal DNA to link adults of the tapeworm Clistobothrium carcharodoni Dailey and Vogelbein, 1990 (Cestoda: Tetraphyllidea) to larvae for which sequence data for this gene are available. The sequences from the adult tapeworms were genetically identical (0% sequence divergence) to those available on GenBank for "SP" 'small' Scolex pleuronectis recovered from the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) and Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus). This study is the first to provide empirical evidence linking the trophic interaction between great white sharks and cetaceans as a definitive route for the successful transmission of a tetraphyllidean tapeworm. Using the intensity of infection data from this shark and from cetaceans as proxies for the extent of predation, I estimate that this individual shark would have consumed between 9 to 83 G. griseus, fresh, dead, or both, in its lifetime.

However, it is far less acknowledged that human activities in the surroundings might have important effects on marine systems. There is growing evidence suggesting that major reorganization (i.e., a regime shift) is a common feature in the temporal evolution of a marine system. Here we show, and quantify, the interaction of human activities (nutrient upload) with a favourable climate (run-off) and its contribution to the eutrophication of the Black Sea in the 1980s. Based on virtual analysis of the bottom-up (eutrophication) vs. top-down (trophic cascades) effects, we found that an earlier onset of eutrophication could have counteracted the restructuring of the trophic regulation at the base of the food web that resulted from the depletion of top predators in the 1970s. These enhanced bottom-up effects would, however, not propagate upwards in the food web beyond the zooplankton level. Our simulations identified the removal of apex predators as a key element in terms of loss of resilience that inevitably leads to a reorganization. Once the food web has been truncated, the type and magnitude of interventions on the group replacing the apex predator as the new upper trophic level have no effect in preventing the trophic cascade. By characterizing the tipping point at which increased bottom-up forcing exactly counteracts the top-down cascading effects, our results emphasize the importance of a comprehensive analysis that take into account all structuring forces at play (including those beyond the marine system) at a given time.

This study presents a comparison of the benthic cover and fish communities in three widely different management systems: (1) a heavily utilized subsistence fishery (yields > 5Mg km(-2) yr(-1)); (2) moderately sized and well enforced fisheries closures (similar to 9% of the nearshore area) surrounded by heavy fishing; and (3) a more lightly used management system (yields < 5Mg km(-2) yr(-1)). 2. The objective was to compare management systems of small to moderate-sized closures surrounded by heavy use in Kenya with a large-scale light-use management system in the Maldives. 3. Gross level attributes of the fish community suggest that the Maldives reefs had higher numbers of individuals (30%) and species (15%) than the Kenyan closures. 4. Maldivian reefs had higher abundance of some carnivores such as emperors (Lethrinidae), jacks (Carangidae), triggerfish (Balistidae), and trumpetfishes (Aulostomidae). Half the biomass of fish in the Maldives was, however, composed of surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), which resulted in a higher abundance of herbivores/detritivores than found in Kenyan closures. 5. Apex predator species were not a large portion of the biomass (< 10%) in any system and, if remote reefs of the Pacific are examples of undisturbed ecosystems, then neither management system has fully protected apex species.

We used acoustic telemetry to determine movements and habitat use of these sharks at the isolated Rowley Shoals atolls, 250 km off the coast of north-western Australia. We equipped 12 male and 14 female sharks ranging from 0.79 to 1.69 m in total length with transmitters that were detected by an array of 11 strategically placed receivers on two atoll reefs. Over 26,000 detections were recorded over the 325 days of receiver deployment. No sharks were observed to move between reefs. Receivers on the outer slopes of reefs provided nearly all (99%) of the detections. We found no differences in general attendance parameters due to size, sex or reef, except for maximum period of detection where larger sharks were detected over a longer period than smaller sharks. Male and female sharks were often detected at separate receivers at the outer slope habitat of one reef, suggesting sexual segregation, but this pattern did not occur at the second reef where males and females were detected at similar frequencies. We identified two patterns of daily behaviour: (1) sharks were present at the reef both day and night or (2) sharks spent more time in attendance during day than at night. Fast Fourier transforms identified 24-h cycles of attendance at the reef and a secondary peak of attendance at 12 h for most sharks, although no individuals shared the same attendance patterns. Our study provides baseline data that can be used to optimise the minimum area and habitat requirements for conservation of these apex predators.	[Field, I. C.; Meekan, M. G.; Speed, C.

The eyes of sharks are well developed and function over a wide range of light levels. However, whilst close relatives of the sharks-the rays and chimaeras-are known to have the potential for colour vision, an evolutionary trait thought to provide distinct survival advantages, evidence for colour vision in sharks remains equivocal. Using single-receptor microspectrophotometry, we measured the absorbance spectra of visual pigments located in the retinal photoreceptors of 17 species of shark. We show that, while the spectral tuning of the rod (wavelength of maximum absorbance, lambda(max) 484-518 nm) and cone (lambda(max) 532-561 nm) visual pigments varies between species, each shark has only a single long-wavelength-sensitive cone type. This suggests that sharks may be cone monochromats and, therefore, potentially colour blind. Whilst cone monochromacy on land is rare, it may be a common strategy in the marine environment: many aquatic mammals (whales, dolphins and seals) also possess only a single, green-sensitive cone type. It appears that both sharks and marine mammals may have arrived at the same visual design by convergent evolution. The spectral tuning of the rod and cone pigments of sharks is also discussed in relation to their visual ecology.

Effects of tourism-related provisioning on the trophic signatures and movement patterns of an apex predator, the Caribbean reef shark	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Behavioural observations; Ecotourism; Non-consumptive exploitation; Shark conservation; Stable isotope analysis; Wildlife provisioning	MARINE RESERVE; HABITAT USE; BEHAVIOR; CORAL; ELASMOBRANCHS; MANAGEMENT; ABUNDANCE; ECOSYSTEM; WILDLIFE; FISHES	Wildlife provisioning, i.e. the provision of bait to generate aggregations of charismatic megafauna as tourist attractions, occurs around the world. This practice is often promoted as an economic incentive to conserve the focal species, yet has stimulated debate based on the potential for risks to human safety and perceptions of behavioural shifts in provisioned populations. We studied a population of Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) in the Bahamas that has been subject to regular provisioning for > 20 years. We used a combination of focal observations of sharks during feeding events, remote acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis of shark muscle tissue to determine the impacts of provisioning on the trophic signatures and ranging behaviour of sharks in this population. A small number of large sharks monopolised more than 50% of the bait on offer. These 'fed' individuals showed significant N-15 enrichment in their tissues compared to conspecifics of the same size that failed to obtain bait at the feeding site, and un-provisioned sharks from a control site. Despite the disparity in trophic signatures, fed, unfed and control sharks exhibited similar degrees of residency at their respective home receiver sites, and travelled similar daily minimum distances. Thus, despite long-term provisioning of this Caribbean reef shark population, there is no evidence for shifts in the behaviours considered which might affect the ecological role of these sharks. However, further research is required to examine potential indirect effects of shark provisioning on sympatric fauna and habitat before this activity can be placed within a sustainable marine conservation framework.

In the Australian region, climatic and oceanographic variability and change have been shown to affect marine species, often with profound consequences. Many seabirds are apex predators for which changes in climatic and oceanic dynamics have driven range movements poleward, reduced breeding success and altered breeding timing for some species. Here we review the literature to assess and determine the vulnerability of Australian seabirds to variation and change in climate and identify which species and ecosystems may be more resilient to future climate warming. It is clear from this synthesis that not all Australian seabirds are affected similarly, with responses varying by species and location. In addition, the paucity of information on the distribution and biology of seabird prey, foraging patterns and movements of seabirds, and the ability of seabirds to switch between prey species or adjust timing of life-cycles make generalisations about potential effects of future climate change and adaptive capacity in seabirds difficult. This applies both within Australia and elsewhere, where data are similarly sparse.

Dietary niche overlap in a nearshore elasmobranch mesopredator community	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Stable isotope; Resource partitioning; Individual specialization; Stingray; Batoid; Elasmobranch; Shark	SUBTROPICAL EMBAYMENT; FEEDING ECOLOGY; MARINE; AUSTRALIA; WATERS; FISH; HABITAT; SPECIALIZATION; AVAILABILITY; QUEENSLAND	Understanding mesopredator trophic interactions is crucial to understanding the dynamics of food webs because mesopredators provide the link between apex predators and lower trophic levels. Using stable isotopic analysis and stomach content analysis, we examined dietary niche overlap within a diverse elasmobranch mesopredator community in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Isotopic values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were consistent with most species being highly dependent on a seagrass-based food web. Differences were observed between the mean isotopic values of species, but there was a great deal of overlap in the isotopic niche space used by the community when examined at the level of individuals. Stomach contents also suggest dietary overlap among the diets of Himantura spp. and Glaucostegus typus, which contained many of the same prey species, primarily crustaceans typically associated with seagrass habitats, although in different proportions. Diet data also suggest that, despite having isotopic values similar to other species, Pastinachus atrus appears to feed on sandflat-associated species. In this community, variation within the groups examined, possibly due to individual specialization, appears to result in high resource overlap and may be a key component allowing for high diversity in this system and is perhaps crucial to understanding the role of mesopredators in community trophic dynamics.

Abundance estimates of killer whales at subantarctic Marion Island	AQUATIC BIOLOGY			English	Article						Orcinus orca; Photo-identification; Population size; Mark-recapture; Southern Ocean; Count	PACIFIC HUMPBACK DOLPHINS; SEAL MIROUNGA-LEONINA; ORCINUS-ORCA; SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION; CROZET ARCHIPELAGO; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; POPULATION; RECAPTURE; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR	Killer whales Orcinus orca are apex predators known to have important effects on marine ecosystems. A fundamental step towards understanding their role in ecosystems, and vital for their informed management and conservation, is the rigorous estimation of their abundance. Studies concerning this species have used mark-recapture analytical techniques to estimate abundance, but enumeration of identifiable individuals is more common. This study estimated the abundance of killer whales occurring inshore at subantarctic Marion Island. Mark-recapture analyses were performed using nearly 10 000 photographs taken from 2006 to 2009. Using careful quality control criteria, we identified 37 ind. The evident capture heterogeneity violates the underlying assumptions of the open population POPAN parameterization in the software program MARK we initially used. We thus used the simpler Chapman modified Lincoln-Petersen estimator, calculating a population size of 37 ind. (95% CI = 29 to 44) for the period 2006 to 2007 and 32 ind. (95% CI = 30 to 33) for 2007 to 2008. Both estimates are close to the catalogue size, suggesting that enumeration is an accurate measure of abundance in this study. Our results are comparable to recent abundance estimates for the neighbouring Crozet Archipelago (similar to 1000 km due east). No rigorous approach has been used previously to estimate the abundance of killer whales at Marion Island. This estimate provides a foundation for further research related to the sociality and potential ecological impact of this population of killer whales in the Southern Ocean.

An impoverished benthic fauna was discovered, that included deep-sea species presumed to be remnants from ice-covered conditions. The current structure of various ecosystem components appears to result from extremely different response rates to the change from an oligotrophic sub-ice-shelf ecosystem to a productive shelf ecosystem. Meiobenthic communities remained impoverished only inside the embayments. On local scales, macro- and mega-epibenthic diversity was generally low, with pioneer species and typical Antarctic megabenthic shelf species interspersed. Antarctic Minke whales and seals utilised the Larsen A/B area to feed on presumably newly established krill and pelagic fish biomass. Ecosystem impacts also extended well beyond the zone of ice-shelf collapse, with areas of high benthic disturbance resulting from scour by icebergs discharged from the Larsen embayments.

Apex predators are often assumed to be dietary generalists and, by feeding on prey from multiple basal nutrient sources, serve to couple discrete food webs. But there is increasing evidence that individual level dietary specialization may be common in many species, and this has not been investigated for many marine apex predators. 2. Because of their position at or near the top of many marine food webs, and the possibility that they can affect populations of their prey and induce trophic cascades, it is important to understand patterns of dietary specialization in shark populations. 3. Stable isotope values from body tissues with different turnover rates were used to quantify patterns of individual specialization in two species of 'generalist' sharks (bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas, and tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier). 4. Despite wide population-level isotopic niche breadths in both species, isotopic values of individual tiger sharks varied across tissues with different turnover rates. The population niche breadth was explained mostly by variation within individuals suggesting tiger sharks are true generalists. In contrast, isotope values of individual bull sharks were stable through time and their wide population level niche breadth was explained by variation among specialist individuals. 5. Relative resource abundance and spatial variation in food-predation risk tradeoffs may explain the differences in patterns of specialization between shark species. 6. The differences in individual dietary specialization between tiger sharks and bull sharks results in different functional roles in coupling or compartmentalizing distinct food webs. 7. Individual specialization may be an important feature of trophic dynamics of highly mobile marine top predators and should be explicitly considered in studies of marine food webs and the ecological role of top predators.

However, ecological studies traditionally overlook individual differences. delta C-13 and delta N-15 were used in conjunction with diet and movement information to identify intrapopulation differences in diet and movement patterns of the apex predator broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus in southeast Tasmania. Sevengill samples from 3 inshore and 3 offshore sites were collected, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 compared between sites, sizes and sexes. Individuals captured offshore had lower delta N-15 than those captured inshore, indicating some degree of spatial segregation. Sevengills also had variable delta C-13 and delta N-15 within coastal habitats, suggesting intrapopulation differences in diet or migration schedules. In comparison to their main prey, most individuals had delta N-15 lower than expected for a top predator, also suggesting that they do not reside permanently in these areas, as their tissue was not in isotopic equilibrium with their known prey. This is in agreement with tracking data that showed seasonal use of coastal areas, with most animals leaving for the colder months but returning the following year. There was also a group of females with relatively high delta C-13 that suggests greater association to coastal habitats, again in agreement with tracking data, as some tagged females remained in the coastal areas over winter. Overall, together with diet and tracking information, results indicate that there are differences in movement and possibly diet in this sevengill population. This multi-methods approach allowed a better understanding of sevengill ecology than the use of any one of the techniques alone.

These trophically transmitted parasites exploit transmission routes involving predator-prey interactions. Porbeagle sharks Lamna nasus are apex predators feeding on a wide range of organisms, including teleosts and cephalopods. Although the biology of this shark species is relatively well studied, there is a surprising lack of information about the trophic interactions involving this species that lead to the acquisition of tapeworms. Recently, the use of molecular tools, combined with phylogenetics, has proven useful in identifying trophic links involved in the transmission of marine tapeworms. In the present study, we used sequence data from the D2 domain of the large subunit ribosomal DNA to link adult tapeworms of the species Clistobothrium cf. montaukensis and Dinobothrium sp. parasitising porbeagle sharks to larvae recovered from the squid Doryteuthis gahi. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to provide empirical evidence for a trophic link between porbeagle sharks and D. gahi as a definitive route for the successful transmission of these tapeworms. Furthermore, our data suggest an ontogenetic shift in diet away from squid. Parasite abundance data in D. gahi indicate that the abundance of porbeagle sharks can be significant in some years.

In the present study, stable isotope analysis (C and N) of blood was used to investigate inter-individual and inter-annual differences in the diet of adult female Australian fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus. Positive correlations were observed between red cell and plasma values for delta C-13 and delta N-15 (r(2) = 0.47 and r(2) = 0.66, respectively, p < 0.001 in both cases), suggesting relatively consistent individual prey choices over 3 or 4 foraging trips. Mean delta N-15 values (12.8 to 17.5%) confirm the species occupies the highest marine trophic niche in the region. A significant decrease in plasma delta N-15 values, corresponding to two-thirds of a trophic level (ca. 2%), was observed between the 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2005 sampling periods. This was associated with a significant decrease in adult female body condition and is consistent with a decline, previously documented by faecal analysis, of the proportion of red cod Pseudophysis bachus, barracouta Thyrsites atun and Gould's squid Nototodarus gouldi in the diet and an increase in redbait Emmelichthys nitidus. While substantial variation in delta N-15 was observed within each age cohort, a significant decrease was observed with age, suggesting individual specialisation for particular prey types is evident early in adulthood, but that its composition changes as females age. In addition, generalized linear models indicated body mass had a negative influence on delta N-15, which may reflect larger total body oxygen stores, facilitating individuals hunting cryptic prey of lower trophic level (e.g. octopus) on the sea floor.

Empirical assessments of these impacts are difficult, however, because killer whales are sparsely distributed, highly mobile, and difficult to observe. We present a 4 yr time series of observations of foraging and feeding behavior of >150 transient killer whales that aggregate annually during the northbound migration of gray whales past Unimak Island, Alaska. Most predatory attacks were on gray whale Eschrichtius robustus calves or yearlings and were quickly abandoned if calves were aggressively defended by their mothers. Attacks were conducted by groups of 3 to 4 killer whales, which attempted to drown their prey. Gray whales generally tried to move into shallow water along the shoreline when attacked; if they succeeded in reaching depths of 3 m or less, attacks were abandoned. Kills occurred in waters from 15 to 75 m deep or were moved into such areas after death. After some hours of feeding, the carcasses were usually left, but were re-visited and fed on by killer whales over several days.

J	Rowell, K; Dettman, DL; Dietz, R				Rowell, Kirsten; Dettman, David L.; Dietz, Robert			Nitrogen isotopes in otoliths reconstruct ancient trophic position	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Otolith Symposium	AUG 24-28, 2009	Monterey, CA			Otoliths; Trophic reconstruction; Gulf of California; Totoaba; Corvina; Colorado River	GULF-OF-CALIFORNIA; COLORADO RIVER; TOTOABA-MACDONALDI; STABLE-ISOTOPES; NORTHERN GULF; LIFE-HISTORY; FISH; WATER; DELTA-N-15; ESTUARINE	The ratio of N-15/N-14 (delta N-15) from consumer and prey tissue is commonly used in ecological studies to determine trophic level, food web structure, and mean trophic level in aquatic ecosystems. There is a predictable positive relationship between the delta N-15 values in tissue and trophic level, caused by the bioaccumulation of N-15 in tissues of consumers with each step up the food chain. Reconstructing trophic structure or food chain length over time may provide resource managers with insights about ecosystem biodiversity and resilience. Yet, in many marine systems the absence of baseline information before anthropogenic disturbances makes comparative studies addressing ecosystem responses extremely difficult. Here we attempt to retrospectively reconstruct trophic position in four species of fish from the upper Gulf of California, Mexico before perturbations such as overfishing or the damming of the Colorado River. We first validated if otolith delta N-15 approximates the delta N-15 observed in fish tissue. We then used the delta N-15 encapsulated in ancient fish otoliths that are between 1,000 and 5,500 years old to define the food web structure. Our results suggested that delta N-15 in otoliths has slightly more positive delta N-15 than soft tissue. The delta N-15 values from ancient otoliths appropriately defined the fishes' relative trophic position. We found significant differences in delta N-15 between functional groups, apex predator versus intermediate predators. Juveniles and adult fishes displayed trophic separation between functional groups. Our findings advocate the application of delta N-15 analysis of prehistoric otoliths for establishing pre-disturbance ecological benchmarks.

That detail, generated by small-spatial-scale but often lengthy experiments, is essential to managing and even restoring ecosystems. My essay focuses primarily on the ecology of exposed rocky intertidal shores, but I believe the derived implications are generalizable to all ecosystems. A mainly experimental approach has tended to avoid a preoccupation with niches but instead has focused on the ecological roles exercised by particular species. Attention to roles has produced a growing appreciation for trophic cascades and their consequences, with obvious implications for the management of fisheries and the conservation significance of apex predators. Some studies are more phenomenological and others more reductionist in focus, but all provide pathways toward understanding abundance and body size variation or a miscellany of indirect effects. Microecology in all ecosystems should continue to prosper independently of a macroecological, predominately terrestrial perspective.

Non-lethal method to obtain stomach samples from a large marine predator and the use of DNA analysis to improve dietary information	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Diet; Gastric lavage; Notorynchus cepedianus; Shark; Stomach flushing	SHARK NOTORYNCHUS-CEPEDIANUS; NEGAPRION-BREVIROSTRIS POEY; PHOCA-VITULINA-RICHARDSI; GASTRIC EVACUATION; FEEDING-HABITS; SALMONID PREY; IDENTIFICATION; FISH; AUSTRALIA; BROADNOSE	Dietary information of apex predators is crucial to understanding community dynamics and ecosystem processes. However, as dietary studies traditionally involve lethal sampling, obtaining this essential information can have repercussions on predator populations and the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. With stronger emphasis being placed on conservation of species that are vulnerable to overexploitation, the need for non-destructive methods of sampling is imperative, as is the requirement to maximize the information obtained from each sample. Stomach flushing (gastric lavage) and DNA analysis of stomach contents methods were tested on the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus Peron 1807. Acoustic tracking and recaptures of sharks implied high survivorship post-fishing and stomach flushing. From 85 prey items collected, 36 (43%) could be identified to species level using morphological analysis. After DNA analysis, a further 35 items were identified to species level, doubling the information obtained from these stomachs. The number of N. cepedianus that were confirmed to have eaten gummy sharks Mustelus antarcticus Gunther 1870 also doubled after DNA analysis. Without DNA analysis (of stomach contents) the importance of M. antarcticus in the diets of N. cepedianus would have been substantially underestimated. In addition, the non-lethal approach provides an opportunity to obtain meaningful information from non-harvested, endangered or rare species or sampling of species within protected areas.

Genetic and historic evidence for climate-driven population fragmentation in a top cetacean predator: the harbour porpoises in European water	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						cetacean; climate change; habitat fragmentation; population genetics; coalescence	PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; TIME DEPENDENCY; NORTH-ATLANTIC; MUTATION-RATE; HUMAN-EVOLUTION; MARINE MAMMALS; LIFE-HISTORY; ANCIENT DNA; SEA	Recent climate change has triggered profound reorganization in northeast Atlantic ecosystems, with substantial impact on the distribution of marine assemblages from plankton to fishes. However, assessing the repercussions on apex marine predators remains a challenging issue, especially for pelagic species. In this study, we use Bayesian coalescent modelling of microsatellite variation to track the population demographic history of one of the smallest temperate cetaceans, the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in European waters. Combining genetic inferences with palaeo-oceanographic and historical records provides strong evidence that populations of harbour porpoises have responded markedly to the recent climate-driven reorganization in the eastern North Atlantic food web. This response includes the isolation of porpoises in Iberian waters from those further north only approximately 300 years ago with a predominant northward migration, contemporaneous with the warming trend underway since the 'Little Ice Age' period and with the ongoing retreat of cold-water fishes from the Bay of Biscay. The extinction or exodus of harbour porpoises from the Mediterranean Sea (leaving an isolated relict population in the Black Sea) has lacked a coherent explanation. The present results suggest that the fragmentation of harbour distribution range in the Mediterranean Sea was triggered during the warm 'Mid-Holocene Optimum' period (approx. 5000 years ago), by the end of the post-glacial nutrient-rich 'Sapropel' conditions that prevailed before that time.

Evidence for a Novel Marine Harmful Algal Bloom: Cyanotoxin (Microcystin) Transfer from Land to Sea Otters	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CYANOBACTERIUM MICROCYSTIS; COASTAL CALIFORNIA; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; AERUGINOSA; LAKE; WATER; LR; ESTUARY; FOOD; TOXICITY	"Super-blooms'' of cyanobacteria that produce potent and environmentally persistent biotoxins (microcystins) are an emerging global health issue in freshwater habitats. Monitoring of the marine environment for secondary impacts has been minimal, although microcystin-contaminated freshwater is known to be entering marine ecosystems. Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, sea otter necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2,900 ppm (2.9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 southern sea otters, a federally listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication. Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of species that are often consumed by sea otters and humans exhibited significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned sea otters were commonly recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for wild otters. This is the first report of deaths of marine mammals due to cyanotoxins and confirms the existence of a novel class of marine "harmful algal bloom'' in the Pacific coastal environment; that of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP), suggesting that animals and humans are at risk from microcystin poisoning when consuming shellfish harvested at the land-sea interface.

We measured spatio-temporal variation in the relative abundance of lingcod, subadult rockfish and two shrimp groups eaten by rockfish (Pandalus sp. and three smaller-bodied genera aggregated). Lingcod had an indirect positive effect on shrimps, as mediated by the direct negative effects of lingcod on rockfish and of rockfish on shrimps. These top-down effects on shrimps, however, were stronger for Pandalus than for small-bodied shrimps. Further, abundances of Pandalus and small-bodied shrimps were negatively correlated and the latter had a stronger positive effect on rockfish, suggesting that rockfish mediated asymmetrical apparent competition between shrimps. Our results indicate mechanisms by which predatory fishes may influence the structure of marine communities.

Patterns and ecosystem consequences of shark declines in the ocean	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Review						Connectivity; ecological role; ecosystem; effects of fishing; evolution; mesopredator release; predation; risk effects; top-down effects; trophic cascades; sharks	GULF-OF-MEXICO; SEALS PHOCA-VITULINA; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; NORTHWEST ATLANTIC; TROPHIC CASCADES; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; PELAGIC SHARKS; SOUTH-AFRICA; FOOD-WEB; EXTINCTION VULNERABILITY	Whereas many land predators disappeared before their ecological roles were studied, the decline of marine apex predators is still unfolding. Large sharks in particular have experienced rapid declines over the last decades. In this study, we review the documented changes in exploited elasmobranch communities in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats, and synthesize the effects of sharks on their prey and wider communities. We show that the high natural diversity and abundance of sharks is vulnerable to even light fishing pressure. The decline of large predatory sharks reduces natural mortality in a range of prey, contributing to changes in abundance, distribution, and behaviour of small elasmobranchs, marine mammals, and sea turtles that have few other predators. Through direct predation and behavioural modifications, top-down effects of sharks have led to cascading changes in some coastal ecosystems. In demersal and pelagic communities, there is increasing evidence of mesopredator release, but cascading effects are more hypothetical. Here, fishing pressure on mesopredators may mask or even reverse some ecosystem effects. In conclusion, large sharks can exert strong top-down forces with the potential to shape marine communities over large spatial and temporal scales. Yet more empirical evidence is needed to test the generality of these effects throughout the ocean.

How Do Polar Marine Ecosystems Respond to Rapid Climate Change?	SCIENCE			English	Review							WESTERN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA; CONTINENTAL-SHELF WATERS; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY; MASS-LOSS; FOOD-WEB; SEA-ICE; KRILL; SALPS; CIRCULATION	Climate change will alter marine ecosystems; however, the complexity of the food webs, combined with chronic undersampling, constrains efforts to predict their future and to optimally manage and protect marine resources. Sustained observations at the West Antarctic Peninsula show that in this region, rapid environmental change has coincided with shifts in the food web, from its base up to apex predators. New strategies will be required to gain further insight into how the marine climate system has influenced such changes and how it will do so in the future. Robotic networks, satellites, ships, and instruments mounted on animals and ice will collect data needed to improve numerical models that can then be used to study the future of polar ecosystems as climate change progresses.

The thermophysiologic status of the great marine reptiles is still unknown, even though some studies have suggested that thermoregulation may have contributed to their exceptional evolutionary success as apex predators of Mesozoic aquatic ecosystems. We tested the thermal status of ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs by comparing the oxygen isotope compositions of their tooth phosphate to those of coexisting fish. Data distribution reveals that these large marine reptiles were able to maintain a constant and high body temperature in oceanic environments ranging from tropical to cold temperate. Their estimated body temperatures, in the range from 35 degrees +/- 2 degrees C to 39 degrees +/- 2 degrees C, suggest high metabolic rates required for predation and fast swimming over large distances offshore.

Pollution impacts all trophic levels, from primary producers to apex predators, and thus interferes with the structure of marine communities and consequently ecosystem functioning. Here we review the effects of sediments, eutrophication, toxics and marine litter. All are presently major concerns in Southeast Asia (SE Asia) and there is little indication that the situation is improving. Approximately 70% of SE Asia's human population lives in coastal areas and intensive farming and aquaculture, rapid urbanization and industrialisation, greater shipping traffic and fishing effort, as well as widespread deforestation and nearshore development, are contributing towards the pollution problem. As SE Asia encompasses approximately 34% of the world's reefs and between a quarter and a third of the world's mangroves, as well as the global biodiversity triangle formed by the Malay Peninsular, the Philippines, and New Guinea, the need to reduce the impacts of marine pollution in this region is all the more critical.

Baited camera experiments and stable isotope analyses have demonstrated that animal carrion derived from the surface waters is an important component in the diets of macrourids, some macrourid stomachs also contained vegetable/plant material e.g. onion peels, oranges, algae The latter observations led us to the question is plant material an attractive food source for deep-sea scavenging fish? We simulated a plant food fall using in situ benthic lander systems equipped with a baited time-lapse camera Abyssal macrourids and cusk-eels were attracted to the bait, both feeding vigorously on the bait, and the majority of the bait was consumed in <30 h. These observations indicate (1) plant material can produce an odour plume similar to that of animal carrion and attracts deep-sea fish, and (2) deep-sea fish readily eat plant material This represents to our knowledge the first in situ documentation of deep-sea fish ingesting plant material and highlights the variability in the scavenging nature of deep-sea fishes This may have implications for food webs in areas where macrophyte/seagrass detritus is abundant at the seafloor e g canyon systems and continental shelves close to seagrass meadows (Bahamas and Mediterranean).

The large amount of discards produced by commercial fisheries can have major impacts on marine predator populations: this abundant food may increase populations of some scavengers or decrease others via accidental bycatch. Yet, despite the conservation implications of discard practices, the ecology of individual scavengers is poorly understood. 2. Here, we assess the influence of commercial fisheries' activity on the foraging behaviour of individual breeding northern gannets Morus bassanus. Using recent developments in stable isotope mixing models (Stable Isotope Analysis in R or SIAR) we estimate individual discard consumption. Using GPS tracking and the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), we investigate behavioural responses to trawlers. 3. Analysis of conventional diet samples, as well as stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in blood (plasma and cells), highlight marked individual differences in the proportion of fishery discards in the diet. Individual differences in foraging behaviour revealed by stable isotopes show evidence of both short-term consistency and behavioural flexibility. 4. At-sea path tortuosity of 25 gannets (tracked using GPS loggers) revealed scale-dependent adjustments in response to VMS-derived fishing vessel locations, as well as to sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration and copepod abundance. The results also indicate individual variability in behavioural response to trawlers. 5. Individual differences in the amount of discards estimated from SIAR were negatively correlated with differences in foraging trip length and body condition, indicating potential fitness consequences. 6. Synthesis and applications. The management of commercial fisheries and apex predators is a daunting task. Ultimately, reducing bycatch and removing dependency on discards remain key conservation priorities, but managers should also ensure that scavenging species have sufficient alternative food to meet their energetic needs, to ameliorate potential unforeseen knock-on consequences. The results of Stable Isotope Analysis (SIAR) reveal intra-population differences in discard consumption by gannets; differences that have impacts on foraging effort and body condition. The use of GPS tracking and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) reveal that gannet at-sea behaviour is influenced by fishing vessels, although this also varies among individuals. A combination of SIAR, GPS tracking and VMS can be used to study fishery/scavenger interactions in detail at the individual level, to answer fundamental questions about scavenging behaviour.

Linking killer whale survival and prey abundance: food limitation in the oceans' apex predator?	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						killer whale; Orcinus orca; predation	ORCINUS-ORCA; BRITISH-COLUMBIA	Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are large predators that occupy the top trophic position in the world's oceans and as such may have important roles in marine ecosystem dynamics. Although the possible top-down effects of killer whale predation on populations of their prey have received much recent attention, little is known of how the abundance of these predators may be limited by bottom-up processes. Here we show, using 25 years of demographic data from two populations of fish-eating killer whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, that population trends are driven largely by changes in survival, and that survival rates are strongly correlated with the availability of their principal prey species, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Our results suggest that, although these killer whales may consume a variety of fish species, they are highly specialized and dependent on this single salmonid species to an extent that it is a limiting factor in their population dynamics. Other ecologically specialized killer whale populations may be similarly constrained to a narrow range of prey species by culturally inherited foraging strategies, and thus are limited in their ability to adapt rapidly to changing prey availability.

Climate, Critters, and Cetaceans: Cenozoic Drivers of the Evolution of Modern Whales	SCIENCE			English	Article							ANTARCTIC CIRCUMPOLAR CURRENT; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; DYNAMICS; NUTRIENT	Modern cetaceans, a poster child of evolution, play an important role in the ocean ecosystem as apex predators and nutrient distributors, as well as evolutionary "stepping stones" for the deep sea biota. Recent discussions on the impact of climate change and marine exploitation on current cetacean populations may benefit from insights into what factors have influenced cetacean diversity in the past. Previous studies suggested that the rise of diatoms as dominant marine primary producers and global temperature change were key factors in the evolution of modern whales. Based on a comprehensive diversity data set, we show that much of observed cetacean paleodiversity can indeed be explained by diatom diversity in conjunction with variations in climate as indicated by oxygen stable isotope records (delta(18)O).

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of their phylogeny, character evolution and host associations based on 10 years of sampling effort, including representatives of 12 of 15 and 44 of 66 currently recognized trypanorhynch families and genera, respectively. Using a combination of ssrDNA and 1srDNA (Domains 1-3) for 79 and 80 taxa, respectively, we maintain one-to-one correspondence between molecules and morphology by scoring 45 characters from the same specimens used for sequencing, and provide museum Vouchers for this material. Host associations are examined through likelihood-based ancestral character state reconstructions (ACSRs) and by estimating dates of divergence using strict and relaxed molecular clock models in a Bayesian context. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses of rDNA produced well-resolved and strongly supported trees in which the trypanorhynchs formed two primary lineages and were monophyletic with respect to the diphyllidean outgroup taxa. These lineages showed marked differences in their rates of divergence which in turn resulted in differing support and stability characteristics within the lineages. Mapping of morphological characters onto the tree resulting from combined analysis of rDNA showed most traits to be highly plastic, including some previously considered of key taxonomic importance such as underlying symmetries in tentacular armature. The resulting tree was found to be congruent with the most recent morphologically based superfarmily designations in the order, providing support for four proposed superfamilies, but not for the Tentacularioidea and Eutetrarhynchoidea. ACSRs based on the combined analysis of rDNA estimated the original hosts of the two primary parasite lineages to be alternatively rajiform batoids and carcharhiniform sharks. This fundamental split provides independent support for rejecting the notion that rays are derived sharks, and thus supports the most recent molecular phylogenies of the Neoselachii. Beyond the basal split between shark- and ray-inhabiting lineages, no pattern was found to suggest that the trypanorhynchs have closely tracked the evolutionary histories of these host lineages, but instead, it appears that host-switching has been common and that the subsequent evolution of the parasites has been ecologically driven primarily through overlap in the niches of their shark and ray hosts. Using a relaxed molecular clock model calibrated by means of host fossil data, the ray-inhabiting lineage is estimated to have diversified around the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary, whereas the shark-inhabiting lineage is estimated to have diversified later, in the Middle Cretaceous. Although the large error associated with the estimated divergence dates prevents robust conclusions from being drawn, the dates are nevertheless found to be consistent in a relative sense with the origins of their major hosts groups. The erection and definition of the suborders Trypanobatoida and Trypanoselachoida, for the major clades of trypanorhynchs parasitizing primarily rays and sharks, respectively, is proposed for the two primary lineages recovered here.

The losses have modified or even eliminated concatenations of indirect interactions propagating from predators to herbivores to plants, inter alia. Food webs are a synthesis of bottom-up energy and nutrient flow from plant producers to consumers and top-down regulation of producers by consumers. The trophic cascade is the simplest top-down interaction and accounts for a great deal of what is known about food webs. In three-link cascades, predators suppress herbivores, releasing plants. In longer cascades, predators can suppress smaller mesopredators, releasing their prey animals. Hunting, fishing, and whaling have brought parallel losses of large apex predators to food webs. Without apex predators, smaller mesopredators have often become superabundant, sometimes with unprecedented suppression of their prey, extinctions, and endangerment. Flourishing mesopredators also can reverse the web regulation and suppress apex predators that have become rare owing to hunting and fishing. This can prevent fisheries recovery and lead to persistent alternative ecosystem states. Although food-web modules of large animals are increasingly well understood, the parts of webs consisting of small inconspicuous organisms, such as mutualists and parasites, and webs in obscure places, such as in the soil, are much of the challenge of future research.

Social cohesion among kin, gene flow without dispersal and the evolution of population genetic structure in the killer whale (Orcinus orca)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						behavioural isolation; breeding system; dispersal patterns; ecotype; gene flow; genetic divergence; kin structure; marine mammal; Orcinus orca	EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPES; MIGRATION RATES; RELATEDNESS; ECOLOGY; DIFFERENTIATION; RECONSTRUCTION; ASSIGNMENT; STABILITY; INFERENCE	In social species, breeding system and gregarious behavior are key factors influencing the evolution of large-scale population genetic structure. The killer whale is a highly social apex predator showing genetic differentiation in sympatry between populations of foraging specialists (ecotypes), and low levels of genetic diversity overall. Our comparative assessments of kinship, parentage and dispersal reveal high levels of kinship within local populations and ongoing male-mediated gene flow among them, including among ecotypes that are maximally divergent within the mtDNA phylogeny. Dispersal from natal populations was rare, implying that gene flow occurs without dispersal, as a result of reproduction during temporary interactions. Discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies was consistent with earlier studies suggesting a stochastic basis for the magnitude of mtDNA differentiation between matrilines. Taken together our results show how the killer whale breeding system, coupled with social, dispersal and foraging behaviour, contributes to the evolution of population genetic structure.

In general, individuals from both locations consumed the same broad dietary categories (sharks, batoids, teleosts and mammals). However, within these categories, species composition differed. Variations in chondrichthyan prey consumed matched estimations of prey abundance: Mustelus antarcticus was the primary prey in Norfolk Bay, where it was also the most abundant prey species; similarly, Squalus acanthias was an important prey and the most abundant in the Derwent Estuary. A decline in the catch rates of N. cepedianus and elasmobranch prey, in particular M. antarcticus over 3 years coincided with declines in dietary occurrence of M. antarcticus. Also, N. cepedianus and M. antarcticus abundances were both higher in Norfolk Bay than the Derwent Estuary. The correlation with diet and estimations of predator and prey relative abundance suggests N. cepedianus may move into coastal areas to exploit regular seasonal abundant resources, but they can also be versatile opportunistic predators that exploit a temporarily abundant resource.

Also, samples of primary producers and potential prey species from the study area were collected to characterise the local isotopic landscape. This characterisation indicated that delta C-13 values increased from offshore to nearshore and that delta N-15 was a good proxy for trophic level. Therefore, the most coastal species were Monachus monachus and Sousa teuszii, whereas the most pelagic were Physeter macrocephalus and Balaenoptera acutorostrata. delta N-15 values indicated that marine mammals located at the lowest trophic level were B. acutorostrata, Stenella coeruleoalba and Delphinus sp., and those occupying the highest trophic level were M. monachus and P. macrocephalus. The trophic level of Orcinus orca was similar to that of M. monachus, suggesting that O. orca preys on fish. Conservation of coastal and threatened species (M. monachus and S. teuszii) off NW Africa should be a priority because these species, as the main apex predators, cannot be replaced by other marine mammals.

Structural patterns reflect natural ecological processes that are not influenced by fishing or other anthropogenic factors. The most striking feature of this assemblage is an inverted biomass pyramid dominated by apex predators, primarily sharks and large snappers, across all depth and habitat strata examined. This pattern is most pronounced at greater depths (20 m) on the fore reef. Apex predators dominated to lesser extents in back-reef, patch-reef, and shallow fore-reef habitats. Prey assemblage size spectra showed fewer large prey and greater numbers of prey from small size classes at locations with greater piscivore biomass. Other patterns of prey abundance generally conformed to those previously observed at more commonly encountered, human-altered reefs (e. g. highest herbivore abundance on back reefs and shallower depths on the fore reefs; greater planktivore prevalence deeper on the fore reef). The latter patterns, however, inadvertently miss the less obvious differences in assemblage dynamics that result from alterations in the size structures of prey fish populations where apex predators have been heavily exploited or extirpated. The present study of a fully intact coral reef suggests that (1) piscivores are common across all habitats and depths, (2) the presence of predators does not lead to appreciable reductions in the biomass of other guilds, and (3) predators alter the size structure and therefore the potential productivity and energy flow of the ecosystem.

However, community-wide effects of reserves are less clear. Marine reserves directly reduce fishing mortality rates, but through the restoration of apex predators, reserves may have strong indirect effects on non-target species. We explored the effects of a large, fully protected marine reserve in the Bahamas on the community of coral-reef fishes. We examined the effect of the reserve on fish biomass by comparing the density and size of all fishes on similar reefs located inside and outside the reserve. Total biomass of fishes was approximately 7 x higher in reserve sites, where biomass was strongly concentrated in species of higher trophic levels. Analysis based on the relative magnitude of individual species' responses indicated that, on average, the largest species increased in biomass within the reserve, intermediate-sized species decreased, and the smallest species exhibited variable responses. Species' responses to the reserve were also examined by pooling species into 9 trophic categories using consumptive relationships, which provided corroborating results. Large piscivores (e. g. sharks, large groupers) were on average larger and more abundant inside the reserve. Mid-trophic-level groups (e. g. small piscivores) had higher average biomass outside of the reserve, where the number of species and biomass of large predators was lower. Finally, some low-trophic-level groups (e. g. planktivores) had higher biomass within the reserve, while others (e. g. small herbivores) did not respond strongly. Overall, these results suggest that marine reserves can substantially alter the composition and structure of reef fish communities.

We found the occurrence of small-scale 'hotspots', where 50% of all animals were actively foraging in less than 5% of the 1000 km of transects surveyed. By investigating a contrasting range of foraging strategies across a variety of fish-eating seabirds and marine mammals, we determined which habitat characteristics were consistently important across species. A static habitat variable, tidal stratification, log(10)(h/U-3) (h = water depth, U = tidal current amplitude), was found to be the best indicator of the probability of presence and abundance of individual species. All 7 mobile top-predators preferentially foraged within habitats with small-scale (2 to 10 km) patches having (1) high concentrations of chlorophyll in the sub-surface chlorophyll maximum (CHLmax) and (2) high variance in bottom topography, with different species preferring to forage in different locations within these habitats. Patchiness of CHLmax was not associated with the locations of strong horizontal temperature gradients (fronts) or high surface chlorophyll values, but instead may be related to areas of high sub-surface primary production due to locally increased vertical mixing. These small-scale areas represent a newly identified class of spatially important location that may play a critical role within the trophic coupling of shallow seas. Such subsurface hotspots may represent the limited locations where the majority of predator-prey interactions occur, despite making up only a small percentage of the marine environment.	[Scott, B.
